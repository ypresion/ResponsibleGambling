There’s a reason we paid out millions to our participants last year - our challenges are fun, effective, and people love to win money for losing weight!\n\nAccording to one of our participants, “HealthyWage has flipped on a switch that I just couldn’t seem to get clicked on by myself. Not sure, or what science is behind it, but this...is astounding!”\n\nWe flip on that switch for participants looking to get healthier over and over again. In fact, 78% of our participants report weight loss¹ when participating in a HealthyWage Challenge, with an average prize payout of $1,239². Oh, and we DO know the science behind it. We’re kind of nerdy like that!\n\nCheck out some of the features you’ll enjoy with the HealthyWage app:\n\n- Take and post-victory and before-and-after photos\n- Participate with a vibrant community for support and accountability\n- Keep track of your weight loss and your progress toward hitting your goal (and winning money!)\n- Track your step activity throughout the day\n- Create and submit your beginning and ending weigh-in verification videos\n- Access your winnings to cash out or begin another challenge\n- Keep an eye on your standing among other players\n- Build friendships, get inspired by others success, and practice your best cheerleading skills\n- Easily find and enter new challenges\n\nThere are 4 different types of HealthyWage Challenges you can join through the app. Those are:\n\nThe HealthyWager\nWin up to $10,000 in an individual weight loss bet.  Set the terms using the Prize Calculator (you choose your weight loss goal, wager amount, etc.).  Play with the calculator all you like without commitment.\n\n$10,000 Team Challenge\nTeams of five compete to win cash prizes -- first prize is $10,000.\n\nJackpot Challenges\nIndividuals and teams try to achieve specific weight loss goals to earn a share of the pot.\n\nStep Challenge\nIndividuals and teams connect step devices to calculate a custom goal. Achieve the step goal and earn a share of the pot! Devices available: Apple Health (Apple phones and watches via HealthKit), Garmin and Fitbit.\n\nHealthyWage's weight loss challenges have been featured on the Today show, Good Morning America, CNN, ABC News, NBC News, Fox News, and in The Wall Street Journal & The New York Times.\nFrom our participants:\n\n“HealthyWage is great for motivation. People have good intentions but lack the motivation. After having to stick with it for a period of time, that helps you change your habits for good and a healthy lifestyle becomes your new habit.”\n\n\"HealthyWage really exploited my competitive nature and used it to work for me!”\n\n“There's nothing better than losing weight, feeling great, getting healthy AND winning money at the same time!\"\n\n\"Putting up my own money definitely helped me win...the thought of the prize kept me focused. And, as weight started to come off, I was very excited about the process. It was not as hard as I thought it would be once I got my mind focused. I would definitely (and have) recommended this program to my friends! For people who are competitive, it will definitely motivate them to win!”\n\n“I would not have seen the results I got without HealthyWage. It offers something totally unique and takes away all the excuse.”\n\nOnce you experience the thrill of HealthyWage, you'll never go back to struggling on your own. Try it and see for yourself!

You can even use one of your own photos as the background! \n - Progress through the levels and earn new titles\n - Celebrate your wins with exciting winning animations! \n - Maximize your score and climb the weekly, monthly, and all-time leaderboards! \n - Keep track of your skills with personal leaderboards and statistics\n - Easy tap to move interactions for quick gameplay \n - Landscape and portrait view options \n \n MORE FUN CARD GAMES BY MOBILITYWARE\n - Solitaire, also known as Klondike or Patience\n - Spider Solitaire\n - FreeCell\n - Castle Solitaire \n - Pyramid Solitaire \n - Crown Solitaire \n - Tripeaks Solitaire \n - Jigsaw Puzzle\n - Destination Solitaire \n - Blackjack casino game \n \n LIKE US on Facebook http://www.facebook.com/mobilitywaresolitaire \n \n Questions?

I found one that I enjoyed, but after playing it extensively I found it too easy to beat the computer every time. Suddenly the problem with pool hit me — when you play against a computer in a physics simulation, you're literally playing against a god... By which I mean, either the computer is going easy on you (for a reason), or it's playing a perfect game and taking all your money.\n\nIt dawned on me that if I wanted a good single player pool game, I'd have to make a new kind of pool — a variant that doesn't need a computer opponent, that's built around the notion of scoring and improving, of taking risks, and of presenting unique and interesting challenges.\n\nPocket-Run Pool is the game I came up with, I hope you enjoy it!\n\n-zach","genres":["Games","Puzzle","Entertainment","Sports"],"contentRating":"9+","released":"2018-05-23T13:59:24Z","updated":"2019-12-12T22:33:39Z","releaseNotes":"- fixed a bug where turns would not always end","version":"2.0.8","price":0,"developer":"Zach Gage","score":4,"reviews":141,"currentVersionScore":3.5,"currentVersionReviews":8},{"appId":"com.lootwinner.matchandmoney","title":"Match & Money - Real Money Gambling Match 3 Casino Arcade Game","description":"Love Las Vegas style Casino Slots and Match 3 Puzzle games for Real Money?

Our special panic button will help take your mind off of having an urge by showing you pictures of puppies.\n6. Our badge system allows you to be rewarded for your success. \n\nHere are our top 10 reasons to stop being addicted to gambling:\n\n1. Gambling is addictive\n\nNo matter who thinks they have full control of themselves, gambling has been known to take hold and pull people away from their life savings. When you win for the first time, you get a rush of endorphins, and you will be chasing that feeling forever. Acknowledge that this can happen, and cut all ties with gambling.\n\n2. Gambling addiction can make you avoid your life and responsibilities\n\nYou may lose interest in your job and start to drift away into day dreams of hitting it big with your next jackpot. Before you know it, performance might slip at work and you could be fired, or even quit your job looking for the next big hit!\n\n3. Gambling will not make you rich\n\nI am sure that you have heard stories of someone hitting the multi-million dollar jackpot, but the odds of that happening are slim. Most gambling addicts will simply waste away their money until they have nothing left. Gambling is not a sustainable lifestyle.\n\n4. Gambling is stressful\n\nBe honest with yourself. You’re not always going to be winning when gambling. In fact, you will be doing a lot more losing than winning. When you are losing, you are stressing. You are losing money, and putting detrimental physical stress upon yourself.\n\n5. Gambling addiction will change your mood and you may become rude\n\nPeople who are addicted to gambling can bend their own morals for the benefit of their addiction. Lashing out at people is not uncommon, especially when you think about how much money you are losing. Don’t let the addiction take hold of your personality\n\n6. Addiction to gambling destroys your drive\n\nSince most gambling is based off of blind luck, addicts will get the illusion that they don’t have to work for money. This will instill a negative cycle of thinking that any day now you will hit it rich. For most gambling addicts, this doesn’t happen.\n\n7. Gambling ruins families\n\nNobody wants to live with someone who squanders life savings and isn’t responsible with money. Gambling addiction will tear a family apart one way or another. Have you met someone who is ok with their significant other blowing through their income? I don’t think so\n\n8. Gambling is only fun at first\n\nWinning is really the addictive part. You win a few times, then all of a sudden, your mind tricks you into believing that you could gamble more. Next thing you know, you start to get depressed when you are losing money.\n\n9. Gambling can cause crimes\n\nJust like a drug addiction, when cash gets low, gambling addicts will call for desperate measures to get the money to hit it big. This can lead to some serious crimes like robbery, assault..

You remain in complete control during the entire session and will not do anything you do not think is acceptable.\n\n* EFFECTIVE - When in the state of hypnosis, the critical factor of the conscious mind is pushed to the side so the subconscious mind becomes more accessible and open to suggestions. The subconscious mind can also be referred to as your right brain where lays our dreams, intuition, imagination, long term memory, our belief system and our emotions.\n\n* PROVEN - Hypnosis has been an accepted therapeutic intervention by the American Medical Association since 1952 and the American Psychological Association. Added to that, the National Institute of Health has recommended hypnotherapy as a treatment for pain since 1995.\n\n* VALUE - Set yourself free from feelings like fear, frustration, anger, resentment and guilt. Release the blocks that have been holding you back. Break free from negative patterns and negative habits. Let go of painful thoughts and feelings. Transform yourself! Feel lighter and more at peace!\n\n* SAFE - Hypnosis is 100% natural and safe — you are always aware of what is going on. You remain in complete control during the entire session and will not do anything you do not think is acceptable.\n\n--------\n\nBut, will it work for me? Yes!

People who have used this app have seen a great increase in self-control and patience. Just take one day at a time and look forward to the new you without being addicted to gambling.

Our special panic button will help take your mind off of having an urge by showing you pictures of puppies.\n6. Our badge system allows you to be rewarded for your success. \n\nHere are our top 10 reasons to stop being addicted to gambling:\n\n1. Gambling is addictive\n\nNo matter who thinks they have full control of themselves, gambling has been known to take hold and pull people away from their life savings. When you win for the first time, you get a rush of endorphins, and you will be chasing that feeling forever. Acknowledge that this can happen, and cut all ties with gambling.\n\n2. Gambling addiction can make you avoid your life and responsibilities\n\nYou may lose interest in your job and start to drift away into day dreams of hitting it big with your next jackpot. Before you know it, performance might slip at work and you could be fired, or even quit your job looking for the next big hit!\n\n3. Gambling will not make you rich\n\nI am sure that you have heard stories of someone hitting the multi-million dollar jackpot, but the odds of that happening are slim. Most gambling addicts will simply waste away their money until they have nothing left. Gambling is not a sustainable lifestyle.\n\n4. Gambling is stressful\n\nBe honest with yourself. You’re not always going to be winning when gambling. In fact, you will be doing a lot more losing than winning. When you are losing, you are stressing. You are losing money, and putting detrimental physical stress upon yourself.\n\n5. Gambling addiction will change your mood and you may become rude\n\nPeople who are addicted to gambling can bend their own morals for the benefit of their addiction. Lashing out at people is not uncommon, especially when you think about how much money you are losing. Don’t let the addiction take hold of your personality\n\n6. Addiction to gambling destroys your drive\n\nSince most gambling is based off of blind luck, addicts will get the illusion that they don’t have to work for money. This will instill a negative cycle of thinking that any day now you will hit it rich. For most gambling addicts, this doesn’t happen.\n\n7. Gambling ruins families\n\nNobody wants to live with someone who squanders life savings and isn’t responsible with money. Gambling addiction will tear a family apart one way or another. Have you met someone who is ok with their significant other blowing through their income? I don’t think so\n\n8. Gambling is only fun at first\n\nWinning is really the addictive part. You win a few times, then all of a sudden, your mind tricks you into believing that you could gamble more. Next thing you know, you start to get depressed when you are losing money.\n\n9. Gambling can cause crimes\n\nJust like a drug addiction, when cash gets low, gambling addicts will call for desperate measures to get the money to hit it big.

You remain in complete control during the entire session and will not do anything you do not think is acceptable.\n\n* EFFECTIVE - When in the state of hypnosis, the critical factor of the conscious mind is pushed to the side so the subconscious mind becomes more accessible and open to suggestions. The subconscious mind can also be referred to as your right brain where lays our dreams, intuition, imagination, long term memory, our belief system and our emotions.\n\n* PROVEN - Hypnosis has been an accepted therapeutic intervention by the American Medical Association since 1952 and the American Psychological Association. Added to that, the National Institute of Health has recommended hypnotherapy as a treatment for pain since 1995.\n\n* VALUE - Set yourself free from feelings like fear, frustration, anger, resentment and guilt. Release the blocks that have been holding you back. Break free from negative patterns and negative habits. Let go of painful thoughts and feelings. Transform yourself! Feel lighter and more at peace!\n\n* SAFE - Hypnosis is 100% natural and safe — you are always aware of what is going on. You remain in complete control during the entire session and will not do anything you do not think is acceptable.\n\n--------\n\nBut, will it work for me? Yes! Hypnosis works no matter what your belief system is. It doesn’t matter if you believe in it or not.
