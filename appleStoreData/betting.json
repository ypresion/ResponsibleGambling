We send you personalised bets - each called a Bet Request - direct from the Pros for you to Match. You decide what to do next. Do you Follow or Lay?\n\nWhy betconnect?\n\n1.  Real Pro Gamblers\nOur Pros are real professional gamblers who are restricted or closed by the bookies due to their success. Why else would they pay us a commission to get their bets placed?\n\n2.  In It Together\nOur Pros are putting their money where their mouth is – every Bet Request is the ultimate tip. Each one is being backed by one of our Pros. You can trust that they want winners just as much as you.\n\n3. Personalised Bets Come To You!\nYou get alerted when we have a Bet Request for you to Match based on your preferences. With access to the Pro’s stats, you 1can make an informed decision whether to Follow or Lay.\n\n4. Time Is Money\nEvery Bet Request is so good you need to act fast to maximise value. Time is of the essence as you only have 15 minutes to Match and make your next decision…\n\n5. Crowd Betting\nEvery Bet Request you receive is just the “tip” of the iceberg. Our Pros are usually staking much, much more. Our technology intelligently splits the stake and distributes it to Punters like you, so you can share in their success.\n\n6. The Benefits Are All Yours!\nWhen you Follow a Bet Request with other bookmakers you get to take advantage of their Free Bet, Money Back Special and Best Odds Guaranteed promotions. If you lay a Bet Request and you beat the Pro you pay zero commission on your profits.\n\nHow does it work?\n\nStep 1: Connect\nWe Connect you to a network of professional gamblers. Restricted and often closed by the bookies due to their success, they have bets they want to place. That’s where you come in! You’ll be notified when the betconnect algorithm allocates you a Bet Request that meets your betting preferences\n\nDon’t want to wait? Press the betconnect button to be next in the queue.\n\nStep 2: Match\nUnlock the Bet Request to reveal the details of the bet and get the ultimate tip! You now have 15 minutes to Match it on betconnect, safe in the knowledge that the same odds or better are available with the bookmakers… meanwhile you move on nicely to step 3.\n\nStep 3: Follow\nHere’s where it gets interesting…\nJust how good is this Pro?\n\nLove the bet?\nFollow\nBelieve in the power of the Pro and Follow the same bet with your own money. Simply Match the Bet Request and place the same stake plus your own stake with any bookie who is offering the same odds or better. Get Involved!\n\nOr simply\nLay\nBe brave and bet against the Pro by becoming the bookie! Simply Match the Bet Request and do nothing further. Will bravery triumph over experience?\n\nWant to see how it works? Visit https://www.betconnect.com/punter/demo/",

  "description": "matched betting |mætʃt bɛtɪŋ|: noun. 1. a bеtting technique used by individuals to profit from the free bets and incentives offered by bookmakers. It is generally considered risk-free as it is based on the application of a mathematical equation rather than chance.\n\nMatched Betting Calculators is a suite of tools to help you make as much money from bookmaker offers as possible. You can access the Normal, Stake Not Returned and Stake Returned calculators straight away - these will give you the tools to calculate the lay stakes required to lay (essentially betting on the opposite outcome) your qualifying and free bets to ensure risk-free cash.\n\nOnce you understand the basics, Matched Betting Calculators goes beyond other apps to offer you an advanced suite of tools to calculate lay stakes for more complex offers.\n\nThe full app provides:\n\nNORMAL CALCULATOR\nCalculate lay stakes for qualifying and arbitrage bets.\n\nSTAKE NOT RETURNED CALCULATOR\nCalculate lay stakes for free bets (stake not returned).\n\nSTAKE RETURNED CALCULATOR\nCalculate lay stakes for free bets (stake returned).\n\nODDS MATCH BAR\nQuickly view the closeness between your back and lay odds with the Odds Match Bar (available in Normal, SNR, Risk Free and Early Payout calculators).\n\nTRIGGER CALCULATOR*\nCalculate lay stakes for the initial and trigger bets when a free bet is provided after a certain condition is met (e.g., money back on losing correct score bets when a certain team wins).\n\nRISK FREE CALCULATOR*\nGuarantee a profit when there's money back as a free bet if your initial bet loses.\n\nEXTRA PLACE CALCULATOR*\nIf a bookmaker is paying more places in a race than the exchange, calculate your profit should your horse finish in the extra place.\n\nLAY SEQUENTIAL CALCULATOR*\nLay enhanced multiples when legs don't overlap - keep laying until one leg loses. If either the final leg loses or all legs win, you are in profit, otherwise it is risk-free.\n\nODDS BOOST CALCULATOR*\nGuarantee profit when bookmakers are offering boosted odds with extra winnings over the original odds are paid as a free bet.\n\nEARLY PAYOUT CALCULATOR*\nIf the bookmaker settles your bet as a winner early, guarantee profit by backing the original outcome again. Use the Cash Out slider to trade out part of your bet, while leaving the rest in play with potential for larger profit!\n\n2-WAY & 3-WAY DUTCH CALCULATORS*\nInstead of laying a bet, you can choose to cover all outcomes with back bets. Use these calculators to equalise profits when there are two or three mutually exclusive outcomes.\n\nFRACTIONAL TO DECIMAL CONVERTER\nQuickly convert fractional odds to decimal and copy them to the clipboard. Also see the implied chance of the outcome happening from the odds.\n\nQUICK LINKS\nAccess popular exchanges and bookmakers quickly from the app.\n\nSIMPLE EV TOOL\nCalculate the expected value of a casino offer with wagering requirements.\n\nHISTORY\nView your logged bets to keep track of your profits over time.\n\nCUSTOMISE APP ICON\nOption for either a light or dark app icon.\n\n*requires Premium Mode, available as an in-app purchase from Settings.\n\nDownload Matched Betting Calculators today - whether you are a novice or an experienced matched bettor, there is no easier way to calculate your lay stakes and profit on your mobile device. \n\n- - -\n\nDISCLAIMER\nAlthough every effort has been taken to ensure the accuracy of these calculators, you use them at your own risk and the developers shall not be held liable for any loss, financial or otherwise, resulting from this application's use or misuse.

  "description": "The return of arcade pool from the creator of Really Bad Chess and Flipflop Solitaire.\n\nPocket-Run Pool combines 8-ball pool with the thrill of a chasing the perfect highscore.\n\nIn Pocket-Run, your goal is to sink all the balls, but where and when you sink them is what matters most! \n\nWith each pocketed ball, you're awarded points based on the pocket you sunk. So sink carefully, but watch out, with each miss or scratch you lose a life — run out before you finish the table and it's game over.\n\nCompete against yourself, the world, or the bank in a variety of thrilling game modes!\n\nCan you make the perfect pocket-run?\n\nArcade pool is back!\n\n------WHAT THE CRITICS ARE SAYING\n\n5/5 - Touch Arcade\n\"Help me, I can't stop playing!\"\n\n5/5 - 148Apps\n\"Most certainly the best pool game I've played on a phone\"\n\n\"Like the best arcade games, this creates a “just one more turn” mentality\" - The Verge\n\n\"a perfect little mobile game\" - iMore.com\n\n------WHATS IN THE “BOX”?\n\n- Play Pocket-Run Pool's Standard, High Stakes, and Insta-Tournament modes for free!\n- Asynchronously Go for gold against players from around the world in Insta-Tournament mode\n- Manage your risk against all manner of game conditions (like the devious Cuewall) in High Stakes mode\n- Unlock Break of The Week, alternate backgrounds, and remove Insta-Tournament buy-ins with a single In-App-Purchase of just $3.99\n- Track stats for all four modes\n- Win alternate pool cues and color schemes in High Stakes mode\n\n------A WORD FROM THE DEVELOPER\n\nI've always loved pool, and when I got my first iPhone years ago, the world of digital pool games opened up to me. \n\nThere are certainly a lot of options out there, but finding a simple and enjoyable single-player pool game was harder than I expected. I found one that I enjoyed, but after playing it extensively I found it too easy to beat the computer every time. Suddenly the problem with pool hit me — when you play against a computer in a physics simulation, you're literally playing against a god... By which I mean, either the computer is going easy on you (for a reason), or it's playing a perfect game and taking all your money.\n\nIt dawned on me that if I wanted a good single player pool game, I'd have to make a new kind of pool — a variant that doesn't need a computer opponent, that's built around the notion of scoring and improving, of taking risks, and of presenting unique and interesting challenges.\n\nPocket-Run Pool is the game I came up with, I hope you enjoy it!\n\n-zach",
