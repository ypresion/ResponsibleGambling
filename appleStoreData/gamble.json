So sink carefully, but watch out, with each miss or scratch you lose a life — run out before you finish the table and it's game over.\n\nCompete against yourself, the world, or the bank in a variety of thrilling game modes!\n\nCan you make the perfect pocket-run?\n\nArcade pool is back!\n\n------WHAT THE CRITICS ARE SAYING\n\n5/5 - Touch Arcade\n\"Help me, I can't stop playing!\"\n\n5/5 - 148Apps\n\"Most certainly the best pool game I've played on a phone\"\n\n\"Like the best arcade games, this creates a “just one more turn” mentality\" - The Verge\n\n\"a perfect little mobile game\" - iMore.com\n\n------WHATS IN THE “BOX”?\n\n- Play Pocket-Run Pool's Standard, High Stakes, and Insta-Tournament modes for free!\n- Asynchronously Go for gold against players from around the world in Insta-Tournament mode\n- Manage your risk against all manner of game conditions (like the devious Cuewall) in High Stakes mode\n- Unlock Break of The Week, alternate backgrounds, and remove Insta-Tournament buy-ins with a single In-App-Purchase of just $3.99\n- Track stats for all four modes\n- Win alternate pool cues and color schemes in High Stakes mode\n\n------A WORD FROM THE DEVELOPER\n\nI've always loved pool, and when I got my first iPhone years ago, the world of digital pool games opened up to me. \n\nThere are certainly a lot of options out there, but finding a simple and enjoyable single-player pool game was harder than I expected. I found one that I enjoyed, but after playing it extensively I found it too easy to beat the computer every time. Suddenly the problem with pool hit me — when you play against a computer in a physics simulation, you're literally playing against a god... By which I mean, either the computer is going easy on you (for a reason), or it's playing a perfect game and taking all your money.\n\nIt dawned on me that if I wanted a good single player pool game, I'd have to make a new kind of pool — a variant that doesn't need a computer opponent, that's built around the notion of scoring and improving, of taking risks, and of presenting unique and interesting challenges.\n\nPocket-Run Pool is the game I came up with, I hope you enjoy it!\n\n-zach",

  "description": "Being addicted to gambling is a real thing, and people suffer day in and day out with the struggle. \n\nGambling addiction calendar helps you notice that you are addicted to gambling, and helps you stay accountable for when you let yourself be tempted by the idea of gambling. Use gambling addiction calendar to stop gambling and lower your risk of losing money that you can’t afford to pay back, or family member that love you. \n\nJoin the no gambling movement and stop gambling addiction! People who have used this app have seen a great increase in self-control and patience. Just take one day at a time and look forward to the new you without being addicted to gambling. Not only will this app help you stop using binge eating, but it will help you become more social.\n\nFeatures:\n1. 40 Motivational quotes that will help you overcome your gambling  addiction.\n2. 10 Science based facts about gambling addiction, and reasons to quit gambling.\n3. Daily ticker that keeps you motivated to succeed.\n4. Add reasons why you would like to see yourself succeed. \n5. Our special panic button will help take your mind off of having an urge by showing you pictures of puppies.\n6. Our badge system allows you to be rewarded for your success. \n\nHere are our top 10 reasons to stop being addicted to gambling:\n\n1. Gambling is addictive\n\nNo matter who thinks they have full control of themselves, gambling has been known to take hold and pull people away from their life savings. When you win for the first time, you get a rush of endorphins, and you will be chasing that feeling forever. Acknowledge that this can happen, and cut all ties with gambling.\n\n2. Gambling addiction can make you avoid your life and responsibilities\n\nYou may lose interest in your job and start to drift away into day dreams of hitting it big with your next jackpot. Before you know it, performance might slip at work and you could be fired, or even quit your job looking for the next big hit!\n\n3. Gambling will not make you rich\n\nI am sure that you have heard stories of someone hitting the multi-million dollar jackpot, but the odds of that happening are slim. Most gambling addicts will simply waste away their money until they have nothing left. Gambling is not a sustainable lifestyle.\n\n4. Gambling is stressful\n\nBe honest with yourself. You’re not always going to be winning when gambling. In fact, you will be doing a lot more losing than winning. When you are losing, you are stressing. You are losing money, and putting detrimental physical stress upon yourself.\n\n5. Gambling addiction will change your mood and you may become rude\n\nPeople who are addicted to gambling can bend their own morals for the benefit of their addiction. Lashing out at people is not uncommon, especially when you think about how much money you are losing. Don’t let the addiction take hold of your personality\n\n6. Addiction to gambling destroys your drive\n\nSince most gambling is based off of blind luck, addicts will get the illusion that they don’t have to work for money. This will instill a negative cycle of thinking that any day now you will hit it rich. For most gambling addicts, this doesn’t happen.\n\n7. Gambling ruins families\n\nNobody wants to live with someone who squanders life savings and isn’t responsible with money. Gambling addiction will tear a family apart one way or another. Have you met someone who is ok with their significant other blowing through their income? I don’t think so\n\n8. Gambling is only fun at first\n\nWinning is really the addictive part. You win a few times, then all of a sudden, your mind tricks you into believing that you could gamble more. Next thing you know, you start to get depressed when you are losing money.\n\n9. Gambling can cause crimes\n\nJust like a drug addiction, when cash gets low, gambling addicts will call for desperate measures to get the money to hit it big. This can lead to some serious crimes like robbery, assault.. Read more by downloading Gambling Addiction Calendar for FREE now!",

  "description": "There are 2,500 statements in this trivia game which you will have to assess if they are true or false.\n\nBefore each statement is presented you have to choose a bet. There is a low bet which increases by 1 point each round and a double bet which is (not surprisingly) double the low bet.\n\nThe statements are randomly generated, therefore a low or high bet doesn't guarantee an easy or difficult statement. That's why you have to gamble.\n\nCorrectly assess 10 statements on double bet in a row and you'll be presented with a bonus round in which you'll have the opportunity to earn double the points of your last bet. A wrong answer in the bonus round doesn't affect your game progress.\n\nIf unsure about the answer, you can choose to skip to the next statement, but this will cost you points. If you chose a low bet, skipping will cost double the bet, but if you chose a double bet, skipping will cost four times the bet. The bigger the prize, the bigger the risk.\n\nA wrong answer means the game is over.",

Since 2008, we have been committed to providing leading-edge healing to thousands of clients. Visit us on the web at http://www.empoweredhypnosis.com\n\n* SAFE - Hypnosis is 100% natural and safe — you are always aware of what is going on. You remain in complete control during the entire session and will not do anything you do not think is acceptable.\n\n* EFFECTIVE - When in the state of hypnosis, the critical factor of the conscious mind is pushed to the side so the subconscious mind becomes more accessible and open to suggestions. The subconscious mind can also be referred to as your right brain where lays our dreams, intuition, imagination, long term memory, our belief system and our emotions.\n\n* PROVEN - Hypnosis has been an accepted therapeutic intervention by the American Medical Association since 1952 and the American Psychological Association. Added to that, the National Institute of Health has recommended hypnotherapy as a treatment for pain since 1995.\n\n* VALUE - Set yourself free from feelings like fear, frustration, anger, resentment and guilt. Release the blocks that have been holding you back. Break free from negative patterns and negative habits. Let go of painful thoughts and feelings. Transform yourself! Feel lighter and more at peace!\n\n* SAFE - Hypnosis is 100% natural and safe — you are always aware of what is going on. You remain in complete control during the entire session and will not do anything you do not think is acceptable.\n\n--------\n\nBut, will it work for me? Yes! Hypnosis works no matter what your belief system is. It doesn’t matter if you believe in it or not. Hypnosis works because we all have a subconscious mind.\n\nGive it a try and transform your life today!\n\n--------------------\n\nWe offer auto-renewing subscriptions as well a one-time unlock fee via in-app purchase.
