  "description": "Being addicted to gambling is a real thing, and people suffer day in and day out with the struggle. \n\nGambling addiction calendar helps you notice that you are addicted to gambling, and helps you stay accountable for when you let yourself be tempted by the idea of gambling. Use gambling addiction calendar to stop gambling and lower your risk of losing money that you can’t afford to pay back, or family member that love you. \n\nJoin the no gambling movement and stop gambling addiction! People who have used this app have seen a great increase in self-control and patience. Just take one day at a time and look forward to the new you without being addicted to gambling. Not only will this app help you stop using binge eating, but it will help you become more social.\n\nFeatures:\n1. 40 Motivational quotes that will help you overcome your gambling  addiction.\n2. 10 Science based facts about gambling addiction, and reasons to quit gambling.\n3. Daily ticker that keeps you motivated to succeed.\n4. Add reasons why you would like to see yourself succeed. \n5. Our special panic button will help take your mind off of having an urge by showing you pictures of puppies.\n6. Our badge system allows you to be rewarded for your success. \n\nHere are our top 10 reasons to stop being addicted to gambling:\n\n1. Gambling is addictive\n\nNo matter who thinks they have full control of themselves, gambling has been known to take hold and pull people away from their life savings. When you win for the first time, you get a rush of endorphins, and you will be chasing that feeling forever. Acknowledge that this can happen, and cut all ties with gambling.\n\n2. Gambling addiction can make you avoid your life and responsibilities\n\nYou may lose interest in your job and start to drift away into day dreams of hitting it big with your next jackpot. Before you know it, performance might slip at work and you could be fired, or even quit your job looking for the next big hit!\n\n3. Gambling will not make you rich\n\nI am sure that you have heard stories of someone hitting the multi-million dollar jackpot, but the odds of that happening are slim. Most gambling addicts will simply waste away their money until they have nothing left. Gambling is not a sustainable lifestyle.\n\n4. Gambling is stressful\n\nBe honest with yourself. You’re not always going to be winning when gambling. In fact, you will be doing a lot more losing than winning. When you are losing, you are stressing. You are losing money, and putting detrimental physical stress upon yourself.\n\n5. Gambling addiction will change your mood and you may become rude\n\nPeople who are addicted to gambling can bend their own morals for the benefit of their addiction. Lashing out at people is not uncommon, especially when you think about how much money you are losing. Don’t let the addiction take hold of your personality\n\n6. Addiction to gambling destroys your drive\n\nSince most gambling is based off of blind luck, addicts will get the illusion that they don’t have to work for money. This will instill a negative cycle of thinking that any day now you will hit it rich. For most gambling addicts, this doesn’t happen.\n\n7. Gambling ruins families\n\nNobody wants to live with someone who squanders life savings and isn’t responsible with money. Gambling addiction will tear a family apart one way or another. Have you met someone who is ok with their significant other blowing through their income? I don’t think so\n\n8. Gambling is only fun at first\n\nWinning is really the addictive part. You win a few times, then all of a sudden, your mind tricks you into believing that you could gamble more. Next thing you know, you start to get depressed when you are losing money.\n\n9. Gambling can cause crimes\n\nJust like a drug addiction, when cash gets low, gambling addicts will call for desperate measures to get the money to hit it big. This can lead to some serious crimes like robbery, assault.. Read more by downloading Gambling Addiction Calendar for FREE now!",

You remain in complete control during the entire session and will not do anything you do not think is acceptable.\n\n* EFFECTIVE - When in the state of hypnosis, the critical factor of the conscious mind is pushed to the side so the subconscious mind becomes more accessible and open to suggestions. The subconscious mind can also be referred to as your right brain where lays our dreams, intuition, imagination, long term memory, our belief system and our emotions.\n\n* PROVEN - Hypnosis has been an accepted therapeutic intervention by the American Medical Association since 1952 and the American Psychological Association. Added to that, the National Institute of Health has recommended hypnotherapy as a treatment for pain since 1995.\n\n* VALUE - Set yourself free from feelings like fear, frustration, anger, resentment and guilt. Release the blocks that have been holding you back. Break free from negative patterns and negative habits. Let go of painful thoughts and feelings. Transform yourself! Feel lighter and more at peace!\n\n* SAFE - Hypnosis is 100% natural and safe — you are always aware of what is going on.

It also displays the current typical odds for each horse updated every few minutes and calculates an estimated 'value' of betting on that horse.\n\nAI Race Predictor was developed by a small team of racing experts including a computer programmer with a PhD in Artificial Intelligence. It uses an extensive database covering all races in the UK and Ireland going back seventeen years. All the standard race data has been considered, including surface type, going, distance, jockey, weight carried etc. \n\nThe real power of the system comes from the algorithms and mathematical techniques employed to combine these factors. These include: fuzzy logic, gradient descent, simulated annealing, iterative processes and algorithms that do not appear in any textbooks.\n\nEnhance your betting experience with the power of AI.\n\n* This app requires you to be aged 18+.\n* Please read the Terms and Conditions of Use prior to using AI Predictor.\n\n* For help and support about gambling [ https://www.gambleaware.co.uk ]",
