  "description": "Win up to $10,000 by making a \"bet\" on your own weight loss, or by participating in one of our many weight loss and fitness challenges. There’s a reason we paid out millions to our participants last year - our challenges are fun, effective, and people love to win money for losing weight!\n\nAccording to one of our participants, “HealthyWage has flipped on a switch that I just couldn’t seem to get clicked on by myself. Not sure, or what science is behind it, but this...is astounding!”\n\nWe flip on that switch for participants looking to get healthier over and over again. In fact, 78% of our participants report weight loss¹ when participating in a HealthyWage Challenge, with an average prize payout of $1,239². Oh, and we DO know the science behind it. We’re kind of nerdy like that!\n\nCheck out some of the features you’ll enjoy with the HealthyWage app:\n\n- Take and post-victory and before-and-after photos\n- Participate with a vibrant community for support and accountability\n- Keep track of your weight loss and your progress toward hitting your goal (and winning money!)\n- Track your step activity throughout the day\n- Create and submit your beginning and ending weigh-in verification videos\n- Access your winnings to cash out or begin another challenge\n- Keep an eye on your standing among other players\n- Build friendships, get inspired by others success, and practice your best cheerleading skills\n- Easily find and enter new challenges\n\nThere are 4 different types of HealthyWage Challenges you can join through the app. Those are:\n\nThe HealthyWager\nWin up to $10,000 in an individual weight loss bet.  Set the terms using the Prize Calculator (you choose your weight loss goal, wager amount, etc.).  Play with the calculator all you like without commitment.\n\n$10,000 Team Challenge\nTeams of five compete to win cash prizes -- first prize is $10,000.\n\nJackpot Challenges\nIndividuals and teams try to achieve specific weight loss goals to earn a share of the pot.\n\nStep Challenge\nIndividuals and teams connect step devices to calculate a custom goal. Achieve the step goal and earn a share of the pot! Devices available: Apple Health (Apple phones and watches via HealthKit), Garmin and Fitbit.\n\nHealthyWage's weight loss challenges have been featured on the Today show, Good Morning America, CNN, ABC News, NBC News, Fox News, and in The Wall Street Journal & The New York Times.\nFrom our participants:\n\n“HealthyWage is great for motivation. People have good intentions but lack the motivation. After having to stick with it for a period of time, that helps you change your habits for good and a healthy lifestyle becomes your new habit.”\n\n\"HealthyWage really exploited my competitive nature and used it to work for me!”\n\n“There's nothing better than losing weight, feeling great, getting healthy AND winning money at the same time!\"\n\n\"Putting up my own money definitely helped me win...the thought of the prize kept me focused. And, as weight started to come off, I was very excited about the process. It was not as hard as I thought it would be once I got my mind focused. I would definitely (and have) recommended this program to my friends! For people who are competitive, it will definitely motivate them to win!”\n\n“I would not have seen the results I got without HealthyWage. It offers something totally unique and takes away all the excuse.”\n\nOnce you experience the thrill of HealthyWage, you'll never go back to struggling on your own. Try it and see for yourself! Start a diet, bet on it, and win big! Losing weight and getting active with HealthyWage pays off in more ways than one!\n\n¹As reported by HealthyWage participants from January 2019 through January 2020. Stat will be updated at least annually.\n²The average prize amount varies seasonally.  The average listed here includes all new bets created from January 2019 through January 2020 and will be updated periodically.",

  "description": "The return of arcade pool from the creator of Really Bad Chess and Flipflop Solitaire.\n\nPocket-Run Pool combines 8-ball pool with the thrill of a chasing the perfect highscore.\n\nIn Pocket-Run, your goal is to sink all the balls, but where and when you sink them is what matters most! \n\nWith each pocketed ball, you're awarded points based on the pocket you sunk. So sink carefully, but watch out, with each miss or scratch you lose a life — run out before you finish the table and it's game over.\n\nCompete against yourself, the world, or the bank in a variety of thrilling game modes!\n\nCan you make the perfect pocket-run?\n\nArcade pool is back!\n\n------WHAT THE CRITICS ARE SAYING\n\n5/5 - Touch Arcade\n\"Help me, I can't stop playing!\"\n\n5/5 - 148Apps\n\"Most certainly the best pool game I've played on a phone\"\n\n\"Like the best arcade games, this creates a “just one more turn” mentality\" - The Verge\n\n\"a perfect little mobile game\" - iMore.com\n\n------WHATS IN THE “BOX”?\n\n- Play Pocket-Run Pool's Standard, High Stakes, and Insta-Tournament modes for free!\n- Asynchronously Go for gold against players from around the world in Insta-Tournament mode\n- Manage your risk against all manner of game conditions (like the devious Cuewall) in High Stakes mode\n- Unlock Break of The Week, alternate backgrounds, and remove Insta-Tournament buy-ins with a single In-App-Purchase of just $3.99\n- Track stats for all four modes\n- Win alternate pool cues and color schemes in High Stakes mode\n\n------A WORD FROM THE DEVELOPER\n\nI've always loved pool, and when I got my first iPhone years ago, the world of digital pool games opened up to me. \n\nThere are certainly a lot of options out there, but finding a simple and enjoyable single-player pool game was harder than I expected. I found one that I enjoyed, but after playing it extensively I found it too easy to beat the computer every time. Suddenly the problem with pool hit me — when you play against a computer in a physics simulation, you're literally playing against a god... By which I mean, either the computer is going easy on you (for a reason), or it's playing a perfect game and taking all your money.\n\nIt dawned on me that if I wanted a good single player pool game, I'd have to make a new kind of pool — a variant that doesn't need a computer opponent, that's built around the notion of scoring and improving, of taking risks, and of presenting unique and interesting challenges.\n\nPocket-Run Pool is the game I came up with, I hope you enjoy it!\n\n-zach",

  "description": "matched betting |mætʃt bɛtɪŋ|: noun. 1. a bеtting technique used by individuals to profit from the free bets and incentives offered by bookmakers. It is generally considered risk-free as it is based on the application of a mathematical equation rather than chance.\n\nMatched Betting Calculators is a suite of tools to help you make as much money from bookmaker offers as possible. You can access the Normal, Stake Not Returned and Stake Returned calculators straight away - these will give you the tools to calculate the lay stakes required to lay (essentially betting on the opposite outcome) your qualifying and free bets to ensure risk-free cash.\n\nOnce you understand the basics, Matched Betting Calculators goes beyond other apps to offer you an advanced suite of tools to calculate lay stakes for more complex offers.\n\nThe full app provides:\n\nNORMAL CALCULATOR\nCalculate lay stakes for qualifying and arbitrage bets.\n\nSTAKE NOT RETURNED CALCULATOR\nCalculate lay stakes for free bets (stake not returned).\n\nSTAKE RETURNED CALCULATOR\nCalculate lay stakes for free bets (stake returned).\n\nODDS MATCH BAR\nQuickly view the closeness between your back and lay odds with the Odds Match Bar (available in Normal, SNR, Risk Free and Early Payout calculators).\n\nTRIGGER CALCULATOR*\nCalculate lay stakes for the initial and trigger bets when a free bet is provided after a certain condition is met (e.g., money back on losing correct score bets when a certain team wins).\n\nRISK FREE CALCULATOR*\nGuarantee a profit when there's money back as a free bet if your initial bet loses.\n\nEXTRA PLACE CALCULATOR*\nIf a bookmaker is paying more places in a race than the exchange, calculate your profit should your horse finish in the extra place.\n\nLAY SEQUENTIAL CALCULATOR*\nLay enhanced multiples when legs don't overlap - keep laying until one leg loses. If either the final leg loses or all legs win, you are in profit, otherwise it is risk-free.\n\nODDS BOOST CALCULATOR*\nGuarantee profit when bookmakers are offering boosted odds with extra winnings over the original odds are paid as a free bet.\n\nEARLY PAYOUT CALCULATOR*\nIf the bookmaker settles your bet as a winner early, guarantee profit by backing the original outcome again. Use the Cash Out slider to trade out part of your bet, while leaving the rest in play with potential for larger profit!\n\n2-WAY & 3-WAY DUTCH CALCULATORS*\nInstead of laying a bet, you can choose to cover all outcomes with back bets. Use these calculators to equalise profits when there are two or three mutually exclusive outcomes.\n\nFRACTIONAL TO DECIMAL CONVERTER\nQuickly convert fractional odds to decimal and copy them to the clipboard. Also see the implied chance of the outcome happening from the odds.\n\nQUICK LINKS\nAccess popular exchanges and bookmakers quickly from the app.\n\nSIMPLE EV TOOL\nCalculate the expected value of a casino offer with wagering requirements.\n\nHISTORY\nView your logged bets to keep track of your profits over time.\n\nCUSTOMISE APP ICON\nOption for either a light or dark app icon.\n\n*requires Premium Mode, available as an in-app purchase from Settings.\n\nDownload Matched Betting Calculators today - whether you are a novice or an experienced matched bettor, there is no easier way to calculate your lay stakes and profit on your mobile device. \n\n- - -\n\nDISCLAIMER\nAlthough every effort has been taken to ensure the accuracy of these calculators, you use them at your own risk and the developers shall not be held liable for any loss, financial or otherwise, resulting from this application's use or misuse.

In It Together\nOur Pros are putting their money where their mouth is – every Bet Request is the ultimate tip. Each one is being backed by one of our Pros. You can trust that they want winners just as much as you.\n\n3. Personalised Bets Come To You!\nYou get alerted when we have a Bet Request for you to Match based on your preferences. With access to the Pro’s stats, you 1can make an informed decision whether to Follow or Lay.\n\n4. Time Is Money\nEvery Bet Request is so good you need to act fast to maximise value. Time is of the essence as you only have 15 minutes to Match and make your next decision…\n\n5. Crowd Betting\nEvery Bet Request you receive is just the “tip” of the iceberg. Our Pros are usually staking much, much more. Our technology intelligently splits the stake and distributes it to Punters like you, so you can share in their success.\n\n6. The Benefits Are All Yours!\nWhen you Follow a Bet Request with other bookmakers you get to take advantage of their Free Bet, Money Back Special and Best Odds Guaranteed promotions. If you lay a Bet Request and you beat the Pro you pay zero commission on your profits.\n\nHow does it work?\n\nStep 1: Connect\nWe Connect you to a network of professional gamblers. Restricted and often closed by the bookies due to their success, they have bets they want to place. That’s where you come in! You’ll be notified when the betconnect algorithm allocates you a Bet Request that meets your betting preferences\n\nDon’t want to wait? Press the betconnect button to be next in the queue.\n\nStep 2: Match\nUnlock the Bet Request to reveal the details of the bet and get the ultimate tip! You now have 15 minutes to Match it on betconnect, safe in the knowledge that the same odds or better are available with the bookmakers… meanwhile you move on nicely to step 3.\n\nStep 3: Follow\nHere’s where it gets interesting…\nJust how good is this Pro?\n\nLove the bet?\nFollow\nBelieve in the power of the Pro and Follow the same bet with your own money. Simply Match the Bet Request and place the same stake plus your own stake with any bookie who is offering the same odds or better. Get Involved!\n\nOr simply\nLay\nBe brave and bet against the Pro by becoming the bookie! Simply Match the Bet Request and do nothing further. Will bravery triumph over experience?\n\nWant to see how it works? Visit https://www.betconnect.com/punter/demo/",

Our Classic game is still just £1 to play, with MASSIVE cash prizes available every week!\n \nAs you only need 8 Score Draws (1-1, 2-2, etc.) from 10 selections to win a BIG prize, unlike an accumulator, an upset doesn’t mean the end of your bet! Also, smaller prizes are available for players who just miss out on 8 correct selections.\n \nWe’ve paid out over £3.2 billion to winners, so don’t miss your chance to win our Top Prize of £3 Million. Download our app and play on the move at your convenience - you could become our next big winner!\n \nClassic Pools\n \nSelect 10 fixtures from the list of 49 which you think will end up a Score Draw. Know nothing about football? Then pick your lucky numbers or take a lucky dip!\n \nYou get 3 points for a Score Draw, 2 points for a No-Score Draw and 1 point for all other results. We only count your best 8 selections, so a few upsets won’t ruin your bet. A total score of 24, 23 or 22 points usually wins a cash prize and some weeks, less points still win big prizes. \n \nIf your ten selections are the fastest games where both teams score, you could scoop our £3 Million Top Prize!\n \nGoal Rush\n \nSimply select 8 games from the list of 35 where you think both teams will score. It is just £2 to play and prizes are won for 8 or 7 correct selections.\n \nTerms and Conditions\nYou must be over 18 years of age and be in the UK to use this app. Please see our website for full terms and conditions: https://www.footballpools.com/static/terms-and-conditions",

  "description": "matched betting |mætʃt bɛtɪŋ|: noun. 1. a bеtting technique used by individuals to profit from the free bets and incentives offered by bookmakers. It is generally considered risk-free as it is based on the application of a mathematical equation rather than chance.\n\nMatched Betting Calculators is a suite of tools to help you make as much money from bookmaker offers as possible. You can access the Normal, Stake Not Returned and Stake Returned calculators straight away - these will give you the tools to calculate the lay stakes required to lay (essentially betting on the opposite outcome) your qualifying and free bets to ensure risk-free cash.\n\nOnce you understand the basics, Matched Betting Calculators goes beyond other apps to offer you an advanced suite of tools to calculate lay stakes for more complex offers.\n\nThe full app provides:\n\nNORMAL CALCULATOR\nCalculate lay stakes for qualifying and arbitrage bets.\n\nSTAKE NOT RETURNED CALCULATOR\nCalculate lay stakes for free bets (stake not returned).\n\nSTAKE RETURNED CALCULATOR\nCalculate lay stakes for free bets (stake returned).\n\nODDS MATCH BAR\nQuickly view the closeness between your back and lay odds with the Odds Match Bar (available in Normal, SNR, Risk Free and Early Payout calculators).\n\nTRIGGER CALCULATOR*\nCalculate lay stakes for the initial and trigger bets when a free bet is provided after a certain condition is met (e.g., money back on losing correct score bets when a certain team wins).\n\nRISK FREE CALCULATOR*\nGuarantee a profit when there's money back as a free bet if your initial bet loses.\n\nEXTRA PLACE CALCULATOR*\nIf a bookmaker is paying more places in a race than the exchange, calculate your profit should your horse finish in the extra place.\n\nLAY SEQUENTIAL CALCULATOR*\nLay enhanced multiples when legs don't overlap - keep laying until one leg loses. If either the final leg loses or all legs win, you are in profit, otherwise it is risk-free.\n\nODDS BOOST CALCULATOR*\nGuarantee profit when bookmakers are offering boosted odds with extra winnings over the original odds are paid as a free bet.\n\nEARLY PAYOUT CALCULATOR*\nIf the bookmaker settles your bet as a winner early, guarantee profit by backing the original outcome again. Use the Cash Out slider to trade out part of your bet, while leaving the rest in play with potential for larger profit!\n\n2-WAY & 3-WAY DUTCH CALCULATORS*\nInstead of laying a bet, you can choose to cover all outcomes with back bets. Use these calculators to equalise profits when there are two or three mutually exclusive outcomes.\n\nFRACTIONAL TO DECIMAL CONVERTER\nQuickly convert fractional odds to decimal and copy them to the clipboard. Also see the implied chance of the outcome happening from the odds.\n\nQUICK LINKS\nAccess popular exchanges and bookmakers quickly from the app.\n\nSIMPLE EV TOOL\nCalculate the expected value of a casino offer with wagering requirements.\n\nHISTORY\nView your logged bets to keep track of your profits over time.\n\nCUSTOMISE APP ICON\nOption for either a light or dark app icon.\n\n*requires Premium Mode, available as an in-app purchase from Settings.\n\nDownload Matched Betting Calculators today - whether you are a novice or an experienced matched bettor, there is no easier way to calculate your lay stakes and profit on your mobile device. \n\n- - -\n\nDISCLAIMER\nAlthough every effort has been taken to ensure the accuracy of these calculators, you use them at your own risk and the developers shall not be held liable for any loss, financial or otherwise, resulting from this application's use or misuse.

  "description": "The return of arcade pool from the creator of Really Bad Chess and Flipflop Solitaire.\n\nPocket-Run Pool combines 8-ball pool with the thrill of a chasing the perfect highscore.\n\nIn Pocket-Run, your goal is to sink all the balls, but where and when you sink them is what matters most! \n\nWith each pocketed ball, you're awarded points based on the pocket you sunk. So sink carefully, but watch out, with each miss or scratch you lose a life — run out before you finish the table and it's game over.\n\nCompete against yourself, the world, or the bank in a variety of thrilling game modes!\n\nCan you make the perfect pocket-run?\n\nArcade pool is back!\n\n------WHAT THE CRITICS ARE SAYING\n\n5/5 - Touch Arcade\n\"Help me, I can't stop playing!\"\n\n5/5 - 148Apps\n\"Most certainly the best pool game I've played on a phone\"\n\n\"Like the best arcade games, this creates a “just one more turn” mentality\" - The Verge\n\n\"a perfect little mobile game\" - iMore.com\n\n------WHATS IN THE “BOX”?\n\n- Play Pocket-Run Pool's Standard, High Stakes, and Insta-Tournament modes for free!\n- Asynchronously Go for gold against players from around the world in Insta-Tournament mode\n- Manage your risk against all manner of game conditions (like the devious Cuewall) in High Stakes mode\n- Unlock Break of The Week, alternate backgrounds, and remove Insta-Tournament buy-ins with a single In-App-Purchase of just $3.99\n- Track stats for all four modes\n- Win alternate pool cues and color schemes in High Stakes mode\n\n------A WORD FROM THE DEVELOPER\n\nI've always loved pool, and when I got my first iPhone years ago, the world of digital pool games opened up to me. \n\nThere are certainly a lot of options out there, but finding a simple and enjoyable single-player pool game was harder than I expected. I found one that I enjoyed, but after playing it extensively I found it too easy to beat the computer every time. Suddenly the problem with pool hit me — when you play against a computer in a physics simulation, you're literally playing against a god... By which I mean, either the computer is going easy on you (for a reason), or it's playing a perfect game and taking all your money.\n\nIt dawned on me that if I wanted a good single player pool game, I'd have to make a new kind of pool — a variant that doesn't need a computer opponent, that's built around the notion of scoring and improving, of taking risks, and of presenting unique and interesting challenges.\n\nPocket-Run Pool is the game I came up with, I hope you enjoy it!\n\n-zach",

  "description": "The return of arcade pool from the creator of Really Bad Chess and Flipflop Solitaire.\n\nPocket-Run Pool combines 8-ball pool with the thrill of a chasing the perfect highscore.\n\nIn Pocket-Run, your goal is to sink all the balls, but where and when you sink them is what matters most! \n\nWith each pocketed ball, you're awarded points based on the pocket you sunk. So sink carefully, but watch out, with each miss or scratch you lose a life — run out before you finish the table and it's game over.\n\nCompete against yourself, the world, or the bank in a variety of thrilling game modes!\n\nCan you make the perfect pocket-run?\n\nArcade pool is back!\n\n------WHAT THE CRITICS ARE SAYING\n\n5/5 - Touch Arcade\n\"Help me, I can't stop playing!\"\n\n5/5 - 148Apps\n\"Most certainly the best pool game I've played on a phone\"\n\n\"Like the best arcade games, this creates a “just one more turn” mentality\" - The Verge\n\n\"a perfect little mobile game\" - iMore.com\n\n------WHATS IN THE “BOX”?\n\n- Play Pocket-Run Pool's Standard, High Stakes, and Insta-Tournament modes for free!\n- Asynchronously Go for gold against players from around the world in Insta-Tournament mode\n- Manage your risk against all manner of game conditions (like the devious Cuewall) in High Stakes mode\n- Unlock Break of The Week, alternate backgrounds, and remove Insta-Tournament buy-ins with a single In-App-Purchase of just $3.99\n- Track stats for all four modes\n- Win alternate pool cues and color schemes in High Stakes mode\n\n------A WORD FROM THE DEVELOPER\n\nI've always loved pool, and when I got my first iPhone years ago, the world of digital pool games opened up to me. \n\nThere are certainly a lot of options out there, but finding a simple and enjoyable single-player pool game was harder than I expected. I found one that I enjoyed, but after playing it extensively I found it too easy to beat the computer every time. Suddenly the problem with pool hit me — when you play against a computer in a physics simulation, you're literally playing against a god... By which I mean, either the computer is going easy on you (for a reason), or it's playing a perfect game and taking all your money.\n\nIt dawned on me that if I wanted a good single player pool game, I'd have to make a new kind of pool — a variant that doesn't need a computer opponent, that's built around the notion of scoring and improving, of taking risks, and of presenting unique and interesting challenges.\n\nPocket-Run Pool is the game I came up with, I hope you enjoy it!\n\n-zach",

  "description": "Being addicted to gambling is a real thing, and people suffer day in and day out with the struggle. \n\nGambling addiction calendar helps you notice that you are addicted to gambling, and helps you stay accountable for when you let yourself be tempted by the idea of gambling. Use gambling addiction calendar to stop gambling and lower your risk of losing money that you can’t afford to pay back, or family member that love you. \n\nJoin the no gambling movement and stop gambling addiction! People who have used this app have seen a great increase in self-control and patience. Just take one day at a time and look forward to the new you without being addicted to gambling. Not only will this app help you stop using binge eating, but it will help you become more social.\n\nFeatures:\n1. 40 Motivational quotes that will help you overcome your gambling  addiction.\n2. 10 Science based facts about gambling addiction, and reasons to quit gambling.\n3. Daily ticker that keeps you motivated to succeed.\n4. Add reasons why you would like to see yourself succeed. \n5. Our special panic button will help take your mind off of having an urge by showing you pictures of puppies.\n6. Our badge system allows you to be rewarded for your success. \n\nHere are our top 10 reasons to stop being addicted to gambling:\n\n1. Gambling is addictive\n\nNo matter who thinks they have full control of themselves, gambling has been known to take hold and pull people away from their life savings. When you win for the first time, you get a rush of endorphins, and you will be chasing that feeling forever. Acknowledge that this can happen, and cut all ties with gambling.\n\n2. Gambling addiction can make you avoid your life and responsibilities\n\nYou may lose interest in your job and start to drift away into day dreams of hitting it big with your next jackpot. Before you know it, performance might slip at work and you could be fired, or even quit your job looking for the next big hit!\n\n3. Gambling will not make you rich\n\nI am sure that you have heard stories of someone hitting the multi-million dollar jackpot, but the odds of that happening are slim. Most gambling addicts will simply waste away their money until they have nothing left. Gambling is not a sustainable lifestyle.\n\n4. Gambling is stressful\n\nBe honest with yourself. You’re not always going to be winning when gambling. In fact, you will be doing a lot more losing than winning. When you are losing, you are stressing. You are losing money, and putting detrimental physical stress upon yourself.\n\n5. Gambling addiction will change your mood and you may become rude\n\nPeople who are addicted to gambling can bend their own morals for the benefit of their addiction. Lashing out at people is not uncommon, especially when you think about how much money you are losing. Don’t let the addiction take hold of your personality\n\n6. Addiction to gambling destroys your drive\n\nSince most gambling is based off of blind luck, addicts will get the illusion that they don’t have to work for money. This will instill a negative cycle of thinking that any day now you will hit it rich. For most gambling addicts, this doesn’t happen.\n\n7. Gambling ruins families\n\nNobody wants to live with someone who squanders life savings and isn’t responsible with money. Gambling addiction will tear a family apart one way or another. Have you met someone who is ok with their significant other blowing through their income? I don’t think so\n\n8. Gambling is only fun at first\n\nWinning is really the addictive part. You win a few times, then all of a sudden, your mind tricks you into believing that you could gamble more. Next thing you know, you start to get depressed when you are losing money.\n\n9. Gambling can cause crimes\n\nJust like a drug addiction, when cash gets low, gambling addicts will call for desperate measures to get the money to hit it big. This can lead to some serious crimes like robbery, assault.. Read more by downloading Gambling Addiction Calendar for FREE now!",

  "description": "There are 2,500 statements in this trivia game which you will have to assess if they are true or false.\n\nBefore each statement is presented you have to choose a bet. There is a low bet which increases by 1 point each round and a double bet which is (not surprisingly) double the low bet.\n\nThe statements are randomly generated, therefore a low or high bet doesn't guarantee an easy or difficult statement. That's why you have to gamble.\n\nCorrectly assess 10 statements on double bet in a row and you'll be presented with a bonus round in which you'll have the opportunity to earn double the points of your last bet. A wrong answer in the bonus round doesn't affect your game progress.\n\nIf unsure about the answer, you can choose to skip to the next statement, but this will cost you points. If you chose a low bet, skipping will cost double the bet, but if you chose a double bet, skipping will cost four times the bet. The bigger the prize, the bigger the risk.\n\nA wrong answer means the game is over.",

You remain in complete control during the entire session and will not do anything you do not think is acceptable.\n\n* EFFECTIVE - When in the state of hypnosis, the critical factor of the conscious mind is pushed to the side so the subconscious mind becomes more accessible and open to suggestions. The subconscious mind can also be referred to as your right brain where lays our dreams, intuition, imagination, long term memory, our belief system and our emotions.\n\n* PROVEN - Hypnosis has been an accepted therapeutic intervention by the American Medical Association since 1952 and the American Psychological Association. Added to that, the National Institute of Health has recommended hypnotherapy as a treatment for pain since 1995.\n\n* VALUE - Set yourself free from feelings like fear, frustration, anger, resentment and guilt. Release the blocks that have been holding you back. Break free from negative patterns and negative habits. Let go of painful thoughts and feelings. Transform yourself! Feel lighter and more at peace!\n\n* SAFE - Hypnosis is 100% natural and safe — you are always aware of what is going on. You remain in complete control during the entire session and will not do anything you do not think is acceptable.\n\n--------\n\nBut, will it work for me? Yes! Hypnosis works no matter what your belief system is. It doesn’t matter if you believe in it or not.

There is something for everyone, from beginner to veteran. And with hourly and daily bonuses and the opportunity to challenge players worldwide on Game Center, the fun literally never stops. Truly universal, it plays on all iOS devices.\n\nMultiplayer Tournament Mode\n\nThe best just got better. Born To Be Rich now includes a tournament mode, where you can play against your friends or find players from around the world in our unique ‘Matchmaker’ feature. Players compete for three minutes to see who can make the most credits. It’s fast, it’s furious, and it’s only on Born To Be Rich.\n\nThe Games\n\nIt’s what this app is famous for. We’ve received universal praise for the variety of games on offer.\n\nBorn to be Rich is our signature game. We love it so much we named the app after it. It has 5 reels and 30 lines and the aim of the game is to rack up luxury items.

  "description": "Being addicted to gambling is a real thing, and people suffer day in and day out with the struggle. \n\nGambling addiction calendar helps you notice that you are addicted to gambling, and helps you stay accountable for when you let yourself be tempted by the idea of gambling. Use gambling addiction calendar to stop gambling and lower your risk of losing money that you can’t afford to pay back, or family member that love you. \n\nJoin the no gambling movement and stop gambling addiction! People who have used this app have seen a great increase in self-control and patience. Just take one day at a time and look forward to the new you without being addicted to gambling. Not only will this app help you stop using binge eating, but it will help you become more social.\n\nFeatures:\n1. 40 Motivational quotes that will help you overcome your gambling  addiction.\n2. 10 Science based facts about gambling addiction, and reasons to quit gambling.\n3. Daily ticker that keeps you motivated to succeed.\n4. Add reasons why you would like to see yourself succeed. \n5. Our special panic button will help take your mind off of having an urge by showing you pictures of puppies.\n6. Our badge system allows you to be rewarded for your success. \n\nHere are our top 10 reasons to stop being addicted to gambling:\n\n1. Gambling is addictive\n\nNo matter who thinks they have full control of themselves, gambling has been known to take hold and pull people away from their life savings. When you win for the first time, you get a rush of endorphins, and you will be chasing that feeling forever. Acknowledge that this can happen, and cut all ties with gambling.\n\n2. Gambling addiction can make you avoid your life and responsibilities\n\nYou may lose interest in your job and start to drift away into day dreams of hitting it big with your next jackpot. Before you know it, performance might slip at work and you could be fired, or even quit your job looking for the next big hit!\n\n3. Gambling will not make you rich\n\nI am sure that you have heard stories of someone hitting the multi-million dollar jackpot, but the odds of that happening are slim. Most gambling addicts will simply waste away their money until they have nothing left. Gambling is not a sustainable lifestyle.\n\n4. Gambling is stressful\n\nBe honest with yourself. You’re not always going to be winning when gambling. In fact, you will be doing a lot more losing than winning. When you are losing, you are stressing. You are losing money, and putting detrimental physical stress upon yourself.\n\n5. Gambling addiction will change your mood and you may become rude\n\nPeople who are addicted to gambling can bend their own morals for the benefit of their addiction. Lashing out at people is not uncommon, especially when you think about how much money you are losing. Don’t let the addiction take hold of your personality\n\n6. Addiction to gambling destroys your drive\n\nSince most gambling is based off of blind luck, addicts will get the illusion that they don’t have to work for money. This will instill a negative cycle of thinking that any day now you will hit it rich. For most gambling addicts, this doesn’t happen.\n\n7. Gambling ruins families\n\nNobody wants to live with someone who squanders life savings and isn’t responsible with money. Gambling addiction will tear a family apart one way or another. Have you met someone who is ok with their significant other blowing through their income? I don’t think so\n\n8. Gambling is only fun at first\n\nWinning is really the addictive part. You win a few times, then all of a sudden, your mind tricks you into believing that you could gamble more. Next thing you know, you start to get depressed when you are losing money.\n\n9. Gambling can cause crimes\n\nJust like a drug addiction, when cash gets low, gambling addicts will call for desperate measures to get the money to hit it big. This can lead to some serious crimes like robbery, assault.. Read more by downloading Gambling Addiction Calendar for FREE now!",

Since 2008, we have been committed to providing leading-edge healing to thousands of clients. Visit us on the web at http://www.empoweredhypnosis.com\n\n* SAFE - Hypnosis is 100% natural and safe — you are always aware of what is going on. You remain in complete control during the entire session and will not do anything you do not think is acceptable.\n\n* EFFECTIVE - When in the state of hypnosis, the critical factor of the conscious mind is pushed to the side so the subconscious mind becomes more accessible and open to suggestions. The subconscious mind can also be referred to as your right brain where lays our dreams, intuition, imagination, long term memory, our belief system and our emotions.\n\n* PROVEN - Hypnosis has been an accepted therapeutic intervention by the American Medical Association since 1952 and the American Psychological Association. Added to that, the National Institute of Health has recommended hypnotherapy as a treatment for pain since 1995.\n\n* VALUE - Set yourself free from feelings like fear, frustration, anger, resentment and guilt. Release the blocks that have been holding you back. Break free from negative patterns and negative habits. Let go of painful thoughts and feelings. Transform yourself! Feel lighter and more at peace!\n\n* SAFE - Hypnosis is 100% natural and safe — you are always aware of what is going on. You remain in complete control during the entire session and will not do anything you do not think is acceptable.\n\n--------\n\nBut, will it work for me? Yes! Hypnosis works no matter what your belief system is. It doesn’t matter if you believe in it or not. Hypnosis works because we all have a subconscious mind.\n\nGive it a try and transform your life today!\n\n--------------------\n\nWe offer auto-renewing subscriptions as well a one-time unlock fee via in-app purchase.
