Classic Pools
 
Select 10 fixtures from the list of 49 which you think will end up a Score Draw. Know nothing about football? Then pick your lucky numbers or take a lucky dip!
 
You get 3 points for a Score Draw, 2 points for a No-Score Draw and 1 point for all other results. We only count your best 8 selections, so a few upsets won’t ruin your bet. A total score of 24, 23 or 22 points usually wins a cash prize and some weeks, less points still win big prizes. 
 
If your ten selections are the fastest games where both teams score, you could scoop our £3 Million Top Prize!
 
Goal Rush
 
Simply select 8 games from the list of 35 where you think both teams will score. It is just £2 to play and prizes are won for 8 or 7 correct selections.

"com.betconnect.app","BetConnect - Sports Betting","betconnect is the world’s only social betting network that gives you access to the bets of professional gamblers. We send you personalised bets - each called a Bet Request - direct from the Pros for you to Match. You decide what to do next. Do you Follow or Lay?

Why betconnect?

1.  Real Pro Gamblers
Our Pros are real professional gamblers who are restricted or closed by the bookies due to their success. Why else would they pay us a commission to get their bets placed?

2.  In It Together
Our Pros are putting their money where their mouth is – every Bet Request is the ultimate tip. Each one is being backed by one of our Pros. You can trust that they want winners just as much as you.

3. Personalised Bets Come To You!
You get alerted when we have a Bet Request for you to Match based on your preferences. With access to the Pro’s stats, you 1can make an informed decision whether to Follow or Lay.

4. Time Is Money
Every Bet Request is so good you need to act fast to maximise value. Time is of the essence as you only have 15 minutes to Match and make your next decision…

5. Crowd Betting
Every Bet Request you receive is just the “tip” of the iceberg. Our Pros are usually staking much, much more. Our technology intelligently splits the stake and distributes it to Punters like you, so you can share in their success.

6. The Benefits Are All Yours!
When you Follow a Bet Request with other bookmakers you get to take advantage of their Free Bet, Money Back Special and Best Odds Guaranteed promotions. If you lay a Bet Request and you beat the Pro you pay zero commission on your profits.

How does it work?

Step 1: Connect
We Connect you to a network of professional gamblers. Restricted and often closed by the bookies due to their success, they have bets they want to place. That’s where you come in! You’ll be notified when the betconnect algorithm allocates you a Bet Request that meets your betting preferences

Don’t want to wait? Press the betconnect button to be next in the queue.

Step 2: Match
Unlock the Bet Request to reveal the details of the bet and get the ultimate tip! You now have 15 minutes to Match it on betconnect, safe in the knowledge that the same odds or better are available with the bookmakers… meanwhile you move on nicely to step 3.

Step 3: Follow
Here’s where it gets interesting…
Just how good is this Pro?

Love the bet?
Follow
Believe in the power of the Pro and Follow the same bet with your own money. Simply Match the Bet Request and place the same stake plus your own stake with any bookie who is offering the same odds or better. Get Involved!

Or simply
Lay
Be brave and bet against the Pro by becoming the bookie! Simply Match the Bet Request and do nothing further. Will bravery triumph over experience?

Using the Footy Index Calculator, traders can see the actual amount a player will sell for after commission is paid, how much total profit or loss will be made and even see what price each share must reach to obtain a profit.

"uk.co.codingcorner.Matched-Betting-Calculator","Matched Betting Calculators","matched betting |mætʃt bɛtɪŋ|: noun. 1. a bеtting technique used by individuals to profit from the free bets and incentives offered by bookmakers. It is generally considered risk-free as it is based on the application of a mathematical equation rather than chance.

Matched Betting Calculators is a suite of tools to help you make as much money from bookmaker offers as possible. You can access the Normal, Stake Not Returned and Stake Returned calculators straight away - these will give you the tools to calculate the lay stakes required to lay (essentially betting on the opposite outcome) your qualifying and free bets to ensure risk-free cash.

Once you understand the basics, Matched Betting Calculators goes beyond other apps to offer you an advanced suite of tools to calculate lay stakes for more complex offers.

The full app provides:

NORMAL CALCULATOR
Calculate lay stakes for qualifying and arbitrage bets.

STAKE NOT RETURNED CALCULATOR
Calculate lay stakes for free bets (stake not returned).

STAKE RETURNED CALCULATOR
Calculate lay stakes for free bets (stake returned).

ODDS MATCH BAR
Quickly view the closeness between your back and lay odds with the Odds Match Bar (available in Normal, SNR, Risk Free and Early Payout calculators).

TRIGGER CALCULATOR*
Calculate lay stakes for the initial and trigger bets when a free bet is provided after a certain condition is met (e.g., money back on losing correct score bets when a certain team wins).

RISK FREE CALCULATOR*
Guarantee a profit when there's money back as a free bet if your initial bet loses.

EXTRA PLACE CALCULATOR*
If a bookmaker is paying more places in a race than the exchange, calculate your profit should your horse finish in the extra place.

LAY SEQUENTIAL CALCULATOR*
Lay enhanced multiples when legs don't overlap - keep laying until one leg loses. If either the final leg loses or all legs win, you are in profit, otherwise it is risk-free.

ODDS BOOST CALCULATOR*
Guarantee profit when bookmakers are offering boosted odds with extra winnings over the original odds are paid as a free bet.

EARLY PAYOUT CALCULATOR*
If the bookmaker settles your bet as a winner early, guarantee profit by backing the original outcome again. Use the Cash Out slider to trade out part of your bet, while leaving the rest in play with potential for larger profit!

2-WAY & 3-WAY DUTCH CALCULATORS*
Instead of laying a bet, you can choose to cover all outcomes with back bets. Use these calculators to equalise profits when there are two or three mutually exclusive outcomes.

FRACTIONAL TO DECIMAL CONVERTER
Quickly convert fractional odds to decimal and copy them to the clipboard. Also see the implied chance of the outcome happening from the odds.

QUICK LINKS
Access popular exchanges and bookmakers quickly from the app.

SIMPLE EV TOOL

HISTORY

"net.stfj.PocketRunPool","Pocket Run Pool","The return of arcade pool from the creator of Really Bad Chess and Flipflop Solitaire.

Pocket-Run Pool combines 8-ball pool with the thrill of a chasing the perfect highscore.

In Pocket-Run, your goal is to sink all the balls, but where and when you sink them is what matters most! 

With each pocketed ball, you're awarded points based on the pocket you sunk. So sink carefully, but watch out, with each miss or scratch you lose a life — run out before you finish the table and it's game over.

Compete against yourself, the world, or the bank in a variety of thrilling game modes!

Can you make the perfect pocket-run?

Arcade pool is back!

------A WORD FROM THE DEVELOPER

I've always loved pool, and when I got my first iPhone years ago, the world of digital pool games opened up to me. 

There are certainly a lot of options out there, but finding a simple and enjoyable single-player pool game was harder than I expected. I found one that I enjoyed, but after playing it extensively I found it too easy to beat the computer every time. Suddenly the problem with pool hit me — when you play against a computer in a physics simulation, you're literally playing against a god... By which I mean, either the computer is going easy on you (for a reason), or it's playing a perfect game and taking all your money.

It dawned on me that if I wanted a good single player pool game, I'd have to make a new kind of pool — a variant that doesn't need a computer opponent, that's built around the notion of scoring and improving, of taking risks, and of presenting unique and interesting challenges.

Pocket-Run Pool is the game I came up with, I hope you enjoy it!

"com.BlackjackApprenticeship.BJATrainerPro","BJA: Card Counting Trainer Pro","Blackjack Apprenticeship's ""Card Counting Trainer Pro"" is the best way to master card counting so you can bring down the house! Blackjack Apprenticeship trains card counters who have legally beaten casinos for millions with the same skills learned in this app!

******** Featured in: New York Times, CNN, ABC World News, Good Morning America, The Colbert Report, Huffington Post ********

Introducing the Blackjack trainer created and developed by Professional Blackjack players. Blackjackapprenticeship.com is the authority on teaching you how to play Blackjack like the pros. With over a decade of combined experience and millions of dollars won, the Pros here can help you take your game from amateur gambler, to winning professional.

Perhaps you just watched the movie “21”, or you’ve read “Bringing Down the House”, you are ready to take your Blackjack game to the next level. This is where Blackjack Trainer Pro comes in to help you up your game - without being an MIT student.

Blackjack Trainer Pro works hand in hand with Blackjackapprenticeship.com. We teach you step-by-step instruction on how to get the advantage over the house.

We don’t give you multiple counting methods here because you only need one: HiLo. We help you hone one counting system and use it to its fullest potential. Be an expert, not a “Jack of all systems.” That is the difference between a gambler and a winner.

Blackjack Trainer Pro helps you keep the Running count, shows you the True Count and guides you if you make a Basic Strategy or Deviation mistake. We want you to be on top of your game when you go into the casino. Practice at home, then run through a few shoes in your hotel room before hitting the tables to freshen up.

******** FEATURES ********

* Basic Strategy – Build your blackjack foundation
* Learn HiLo – the most efficient yet powerful card counting system known today
* Learn how to keep the Running count, convert to a true count and use that information to your advantage over the house.
* Strategy Deviations – We provide you with the charts you need to be successful
* Real Hand Signals – Use the same hand signals as you would in the casino: Hit, Stand, Double Down, Spit, and Surrender!
* Customize your game: Dealer Hits or Stands on soft 17, Resplit Aces, Double after Split, and Surrender are all rule options.
