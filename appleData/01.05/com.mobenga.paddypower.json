I called PP and they said they couldn’t reverse the cash out because bet is ‘in play’....(?) I was told I could put the £46 on the player to win (Odds had by then reduced from 18/1 to 9/2) I imagine if Spieth was tied 20th instead of tied 2nd at the time they would reversed the cash out. I stand to lose £140. I’m not a major gambler, I often have a bet on televised sport just for fun and cheering on the player or players I’ve bet on. So with this happening it has ruined my enjoyment of the event. If this app is not fit for purpose PP should at least accept responsibility and rectify any genuine errors made by punters. Once my bets have been settled I shall close my account, I’ll never use PP again, there is after all loads of bookmakers to choose from. Punters pal! Yeah right"

I play slots a lot and I know you play them at very high risk but the slots on PP are by far the worst on any site I’ve been on, tonight’s example is I played £150 and won £4. I’m not writing this because I’ve lost and I’m having a tantrum, as I say I spend a small fortune on slots every week and I accept you will lose more than you win, I’m writing this so those of you that enjoy slots don’t waste a penny, the average win over the last 3 months is about £1 for every £70 spent. I know PP will say they are monitored by the gambling commission but what they won’t tell you is they set the wins per spin at the bare minimum. If you don’t play slots then the betting app is worth a go. If you do play the slots go somewhere else."

  "text": "Experience used to be quite positive but a bet recently ‘disappeared’ from my account.... a bet I am very confident would have come through! They initially accused me of never having made the bet.... then said I claimed it early.... but it isn’t anywhere on my account. No help, just false accusation. Was told my query would be passed to management and I would receive more info, never heard back. Amount I had bet was v low but it‘s the principal. Have lost all trust."

  "text": "Deposited £20 put it on Roulette landed on black 10 then glitched and was all of a sudden in red then got a message across the screen saying there was an error with the game. Went on chat got through after 20 minutes and was told it would be escalated. Asked for my winnings or at least my money back but no joy. I feel completey scammed. I play to have fun winning is just a bonus for me. Doubt I will get a response or any money back so I suggest to anyone thinking of downloading this app DO NOT DOWNLOAD."

  "text": "I have spoken to the paddy power team about this but I don’t seem to get anywhere. The total goals and corners market has been my bet for years, suddenly a few days ago it disappeared. They say it’s down to the traders but I just don’t get it. It’s been on every major game for the past 10 years so why would you suddenly stop putting it up. I’ve been having that bet every day for the past ten years. The paddy power answer just doesn’t make any sense."

  "text": "For some time this app has had little glitches, like you select a goal scorer to bet on and it actually slects the next goal scorer down. Annoying but you can work around that.  Today the app is just crashing constantly. Closing and restarting doesn’t help just blank screen when I try to place a bet. Had enough, just want my money and I’ll use something else."

  "text": "Have used this app for football bets for about six months. Often obvious bets are unavailable; for example wanted to bet on who would win FA Cup and this not available, however obscure foreign matches in abundance. Presume for addicts only - kind of a fixed odds betting terminal in your pocket. If you want to bet continually on unknown matches great but for the casual punter I’d try elsewhere."
