  "description": "Increase your chances of winning the lottery with Lottery Balls. \n\nEver noticed how there's rollover after rollover without a winner and then multiple people hit the jackpot at the same time. There's a reason for that; people are all picking their numbers the same way. \n\nYou can beat this trend. Lottery Balls uses highly advanced randomising algorithms to find the numbers that other people aren't choosing. \n\nAs well as helping you win the top prize and not having to share it, Lottery Balls increases your chances of winning the smaller prizes. When using other random number generators, including the \"lucky dip\" available at retailers, each row of numbers will be produced in isolation. Using their method, if you're buying more than one ticket, you'll find you're repeating the same number on several lines. That's fine if all you're interested in is the jackpot, but for smaller prizes, you've got a better chance of winning if you cover a wider range of numbers. That's why Lottery Balls generates multiple lines holistically, without repeating any numbers across the different tickets. \n\nEver forgotten to buy your ticket? Lottery Balls can remind you on the day of the draw to go out and get it before it's too late. \n\nCheck results in the app and receive a notification to let you know when the draw has happened. Look up the results from previous draws. \n\nLike playing the same numbers every week? Lottery Balls can save your favorite numbers for quick and easy access every time. \n\nLottery Balls works with any lottery. We've even added built-in generation rules for many popular worldwide lotteries. \n\nThese include:\nEurope\nEuromillions\n\nAustralia\nPowerball\nMonday & Wednesday Lotto\nOz Lotto\nSet for Life\nTattsLotto (Saturday Lotto)\n\nCanada\nDaily Grand\nDaily Keno\nLottario\nLotto 649\nLotto Max\nPick-2\nPick-3\nPick-4\n\nChina\n七乐彩 (Lucky 7)\n七星彩 (Lucky 7)\n六合彩 (Mark Six Lottery)\n双色球 (Double Colour Ball)\n排列三 (Order of 3)\n排列五 (Order of 5)\n福彩3 D (3D Lottery)\n超级大乐透 (Super Lotto)\n\nSpain\nBonoloto\nEl Gordo\nLa Primitiva\n\nUnited Kingdom\nHealth Lottery\nLotto\nSet For Life\nThunderball\n\nIreland\nDaily Million\nLotto\n\nItaly\nSuperEnalotto\n\nJapan\nナンバーズ3 (Numbers3)\nナンバーズ4 (Numbers4)\nハロウィンジャンボ宝くじ (Jumbo Lottery)\nミニロト (Mini Loto)\nロト6 (Loto 6)\nロト7 (Loto 7)\n\nMexico\nChispazo\nMelate\nMelate Retro\n\nPhilippines\nGrand Lotto 6/55\nLotto 6/42\nMega Lotto 6/45\nSuper Lotto 6/49\nUltra Lotto 6/58\n\nSingapore\nTOTO\n\nTurkey\nSayisal Loto\nSüper Loto\n\nUSA\n2by2\nAll or Nothing\nCash 5\nCash4Life\nDaily Derby\nFantasy 5\nFlorida Lotto\nGimme 5\nJackpot Triple Play\nJersey Cash 5\nLotto America\nLucky Day Lotto\nLucky For Life\nMass Cash\nMega Millions\nMegabucks\nPick 2\nPick 3\nPick 4\nPick 5\nPowerball\nSuperLotto Plus\nTexas Two Step\n\nSouth Africa\nDAILY LOTTO\nLOTTO\nPowerBall\nUK 49\n\nWe’re adding more and more of these all the time and we’d love to hear your suggestions for what you’d like included.

No longer do you need to download apps or visit websites of individual lotteries, just to see where you can buy a lottery ticket.\n\nYou can search for lottery retailers closest to your current GPS position, or from any other location you specify.  Then, get driving directions to any retailer with a single tap of a button.\n\nOur comprehensive database of lottery retailers is updated regularly, to make sure you can find the newest lottery retailers — and not be led to stores that are no longer selling lottery tickets.\n\nBuilt into the app is an easy way for you to report any errors or problems with any lottery store location.  Just click the Report Error button on a retailer, and tell us what's wrong.\n\nLottery Places was created by the developer of Lottery Post (www.lotterypost.com), the world's most popular website for lottery players.  You'll find the same quality and dedication to excellence in Lottery Places that has been the hallmark of Lottery Post for more than 15 years.\n\n• Simple to use and get started\n• Lightning-fast searches\n• Great resource when you're traveling or planning a trip\n• Lottery retailers constantly updated with changes from the lotteries\n• Quick and easy reporting of errors and problems\n• Search for lottery retailers near your current GPS position or any other place\n• Just press and hold the map in another location to begin searching there, or enter an address for a precise search\n• See a list of found retailers, sorted by distance or store name\n• See a list of lotteries included in the app, which we update every time we add a new lottery",

  "description": "Bingo Machine replaces the traditional bingo number caller with a simple, all-in-one, iPhone and iPad application. Call American 75-ball and English 90-ball bingo games. \n\nWith a bingo card in hand, Bingo Machine handles everything else — no need for a traditional bingo caller tumbler or expensive electronic equipment.\n\nAs each ball is selected, Bingo Machine keeps a running history of balls so you can see all the called numbers as the game progresses.\n\nThe app includes human and synthesized speech voices. Bingo Machine can read out each ball with recorded human male and female voices, or a high-quality synthetic voice for your language. Even if Bingo Machine is muted, it shows you bingo catchphrases on the screen so you know what to say as the announcer for each bingo number.\n\nUse the Timer feature to call balls automatically, on a repeating interval. Set a time interval and Bingo Machine calls balls until the game is over.\n\nBingo Machine adapts to the game type. For English-style games, call up to 90 balls. For American games, call up to 75 balls with each ball accompanied by its corresponding B-I-N-G-O symbol.\n\nFor group settings, connect Bingo Machine to an external display or projector to show the game on the big screen. This is perfect for charity events, schools and other large room events. You can connect using a compatible TV-Out cable for your iPhone or iPad, or connect wirelessly to an Apple TV using AirPlay Screen Mirroring.\n\nBingo Machine can also be used as a teaching tool for learning numbers in foreign languages. Switch between English, Chinese, French, German and Spanish language options. The synthesized voice can even speak each language so you can hear how the number is meant to be pronounced.\n\nBingo Machine features rich design and finesse. The app is optimized for both the iPhone in your hand, and the larger canvas of the iPad display. It includes a beautiful theme for the new iOS 13 Dark Mode appearance, and is proud to support vision-impaired accessibility needs with comprehensive VoiceOver support.\n\nBingo caller software is typically clunky and complex. Bingo Machine is the opposite. Feature packed and simple to use.",
