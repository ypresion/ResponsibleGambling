In the game, players may choose to place roulette bets on either a single number or a range of numbers, the colors red or black, or whether the number is odd or even. The roulette odds are based on probability.\nTo determine the winning number and color, a croupier spins a wheel in one direction, then spins a ball in the opposite direction around a tilted circular track running around the circumference of the wheel. The ball eventually loses momentum and falls on to the wheel and into one of 37 (in French/European roulette) or 38 (in American roulette) colored and numbered pockets on the wheel.\nRoulette players have a variety of betting options. Placing inside roulette bets is either selecting the exact number of the pocket the ball will land in, or a small range of pockets based on their proximity on the layout. Players wishing to bet on the 'outside' will select roulette bets on larger positional groupings of pockets, the pocket color, or whether the winning number is odd or even. The payout roulette odds for each type of bet are based on its probability.\nThe roulette table usually imposes minimum and maximum bets, and these rules usually apply separately for all of a player's inside and outside roulette bets for each spin. For inside roulette bets at roulette tables, some casinos may use separate roulette table chips of various colors to distinguish players at the table. Players can continue to place roulette bets as the ball spins around the wheel until the dealer announces no more roulette bets.\nWhen a winning number and color is determined by the roulette wheel, the dealer will place a marker, also known as a dolly, on that winning number on the roulette table layout. When the dolly is on the table, no players may place roulette bets, collect roulette bets, or remove any roulette bets from the table. The dealer will then sweep away all other losing roulette bets either by hand or rake, and determine all of the payouts to the remaining inside and outside winning roulette bets. When the dealer is finished making payouts, the marker is removed from the roulette board where players collect their winnings and make new bets. The winning chips remain on the roulette board.\nRoulette wheel number sequence\nThe pockets of the roulette wheel are numbered from 1 to 36.\nIn number ranges from 1 to 10 and 19 to 28, odd numbers are red and even are black. In ranges from 11 to 18 and 29 to 36, odd numbers are black and even are red.\nThere is a green pocket numbered 0 (zero). In American roulette, there is a second green pocket marked 00.\n\n***\nFor more information on the game or the app in general, feel free to contact us.\n***\n\n***For Support and Feedback***\ncontact@phonato.com\nhttp://www.facebook.com/Phonato",

No problem, with one touch you can make a new drawing with the same people! \n► Share last result by eMail. \n► Share a question by eMail. \n► Send a full ordered draw with all question's items by eMail (for instance, to determine in one time an order of passage). \n► EMail recipient autocomplete from your address book: if you choosed people from your address book, their eMail address are automatically added to the recipient list. \n\n************* \n\nThere is also a paid version of this application.

  "description": "Spin the wheel to decide where to drop into Apex Legends!\n\nThis app is designed for players of all skill levels and is designed to: \n > Add spontaneity to prevent the burn out that can occur when always dropping into the same spot \n> Teach you the map. By randomising your drops, you see and learn about more of the map than your opponents. This intel is invaluable in the mid to late game when the playable zone shrinks. At this point your expanded map knowledge could be the key to victory. \n> Add Challenge and excitement. We particularly encourage streamers to mix up their gameplay!   \n\nAdditional modes within the app include Weapon roulette and Challenges. Weapon Roulette allows the excitement of Drop Roulette to extend to your weapon choice! \n\nThe challenges add an extra layer for those players who want to add more risk to their game or just collect medals of achievement. Will you manage to earn the medallion for using a different weapon after each kill and then winning the game? Or the medallion for being the ultimate Apex Legend and winning 10 matches while being kill leader? \n\nDisclaimer: \nThis app is not affiliated with or endorsed by Respawn Entertainment, Apex Legends, Titanfall or any partners.

You can write from 2 to 50 options in different roulettes and use them whenever you want.  You can also add images to each option. The images must be png/jpg and must be stored in your device. The information is only saved on the device, not in the cloud.\n\nIt is free, easy to use and you can find it useful to choose where to eat, make raffles or create your own challenges: truth or dare, spin the bottle... You set the limits! Just type your options and spin the wheel.\n\nTo use this app you must accept -the first time you use it- that the app shows some ads. After that, if you want, you can make an in-app purchase to remove all the ads in the app. You can also make some in-app purchases to add some customization options to the app.\n\nGood luck!\n\n\nP.S. If your language is not already in the app and you want to help us with the translation, we can try to add it.\nIn this case, please, send us an email to treebitgames@gmail.com",
