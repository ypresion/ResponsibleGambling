  "description": "Increase your chances of winning the lottery with Lottery Balls. \n\nEver noticed how there's rollover after rollover without a winner and then multiple people hit the jackpot at the same time. There's a reason for that; people are all picking their numbers the same way. \n\nYou can beat this trend. Lottery Balls uses highly advanced randomising algorithms to find the numbers that other people aren't choosing. \n\nAs well as helping you win the top prize and not having to share it, Lottery Balls increases your chances of winning the smaller prizes. When using other random number generators, including the \"lucky dip\" available at retailers, each row of numbers will be produced in isolation. Using their method, if you're buying more than one ticket, you'll find you're repeating the same number on several lines. That's fine if all you're interested in is the jackpot, but for smaller prizes, you've got a better chance of winning if you cover a wider range of numbers. That's why Lottery Balls generates multiple lines holistically, without repeating any numbers across the different tickets. \n\nEver forgotten to buy your ticket? Lottery Balls can remind you on the day of the draw to go out and get it before it's too late. \n\nCheck results in the app and receive a notification to let you know when the draw has happened. Look up the results from previous draws. \n\nLike playing the same numbers every week? Lottery Balls can save your favorite numbers for quick and easy access every time. \n\nLottery Balls works with any lottery. We've even added built-in generation rules for many popular worldwide lotteries. \n\nThese include:\nEurope\nEuromillions\n\nAustralia\nPowerball\nMonday & Wednesday Lotto\nOz Lotto\nSet for Life\nTattsLotto (Saturday Lotto)\n\nCanada\nDaily Grand\nDaily Keno\nLottario\nLotto 649\nLotto Max\nPick-2\nPick-3\nPick-4\n\nChina\n七乐彩 (Lucky 7)\n七星彩 (Lucky 7)\n六合彩 (Mark Six Lottery)\n双色球 (Double Colour Ball)\n排列三 (Order of 3)\n排列五 (Order of 5)\n福彩3 D (3D Lottery)\n超级大乐透 (Super Lotto)\n\nSpain\nBonoloto\nEl Gordo\nLa Primitiva\n\nUnited Kingdom\nHealth Lottery\nLotto\nSet For Life\nThunderball\n\nIreland\nDaily Million\nLotto\n\nItaly\nSuperEnalotto\n\nJapan\nナンバーズ3 (Numbers3)\nナンバーズ4 (Numbers4)\nハロウィンジャンボ宝くじ (Jumbo Lottery)\nミニロト (Mini Loto)\nロト6 (Loto 6)\nロト7 (Loto 7)\n\nMexico\nChispazo\nMelate\nMelate Retro\n\nPhilippines\nGrand Lotto 6/55\nLotto 6/42\nMega Lotto 6/45\nSuper Lotto 6/49\nUltra Lotto 6/58\n\nSingapore\nTOTO\n\nTurkey\nSayisal Loto\nSüper Loto\n\nUSA\n2by2\nAll or Nothing\nCash 5\nCash4Life\nDaily Derby\nFantasy 5\nFlorida Lotto\nGimme 5\nJackpot Triple Play\nJersey Cash 5\nLotto America\nLucky Day Lotto\nLucky For Life\nMass Cash\nMega Millions\nMegabucks\nPick 2\nPick 3\nPick 4\nPick 5\nPowerball\nSuperLotto Plus\nTexas Two Step\n\nSouth Africa\nDAILY LOTTO\nLOTTO\nPowerBall\nUK 49\n\nWe’re adding more and more of these all the time and we’d love to hear your suggestions for what you’d like included.
