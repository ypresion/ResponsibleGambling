  "description": "matched betting |mætʃt bɛtɪŋ|: noun. 1. a bеtting technique used by individuals to profit from the free bets and incentives offered by bookmakers. It is generally considered risk-free as it is based on the application of a mathematical equation rather than chance.\n\nMatched Betting Calculators is a suite of tools to help you make as much money from bookmaker offers as possible. You can access the Normal, Stake Not Returned and Stake Returned calculators straight away - these will give you the tools to calculate the lay stakes required to lay (essentially betting on the opposite outcome) your qualifying and free bets to ensure risk-free cash.\n\nOnce you understand the basics, Matched Betting Calculators goes beyond other apps to offer you an advanced suite of tools to calculate lay stakes for more complex offers.\n\nThe full app provides:\n\nNORMAL CALCULATOR\nCalculate lay stakes for qualifying and arbitrage bets.\n\nSTAKE NOT RETURNED CALCULATOR\nCalculate lay stakes for free bets (stake not returned).\n\nSTAKE RETURNED CALCULATOR\nCalculate lay stakes for free bets (stake returned).\n\nODDS MATCH BAR\nQuickly view the closeness between your back and lay odds with the Odds Match Bar (available in Normal, SNR, Risk Free and Early Payout calculators).\n\nTRIGGER CALCULATOR*\nCalculate lay stakes for the initial and trigger bets when a free bet is provided after a certain condition is met (e.g., money back on losing correct score bets when a certain team wins).\n\nRISK FREE CALCULATOR*\nGuarantee a profit when there's money back as a free bet if your initial bet loses.\n\nEXTRA PLACE CALCULATOR*\nIf a bookmaker is paying more places in a race than the exchange, calculate your profit should your horse finish in the extra place.\n\nLAY SEQUENTIAL CALCULATOR*\nLay enhanced multiples when legs don't overlap - keep laying until one leg loses. If either the final leg loses or all legs win, you are in profit, otherwise it is risk-free.\n\nODDS BOOST CALCULATOR*\nGuarantee profit when bookmakers are offering boosted odds with extra winnings over the original odds are paid as a free bet.\n\nEARLY PAYOUT CALCULATOR*\nIf the bookmaker settles your bet as a winner early, guarantee profit by backing the original outcome again. Use the Cash Out slider to trade out part of your bet, while leaving the rest in play with potential for larger profit!\n\n2-WAY & 3-WAY DUTCH CALCULATORS*\nInstead of laying a bet, you can choose to cover all outcomes with back bets. Use these calculators to equalise profits when there are two or three mutually exclusive outcomes.\n\nFRACTIONAL TO DECIMAL CONVERTER\nQuickly convert fractional odds to decimal and copy them to the clipboard. Also see the implied chance of the outcome happening from the odds.\n\nQUICK LINKS\nAccess popular exchanges and bookmakers quickly from the app.\n\nSIMPLE EV TOOL\nCalculate the expected value of a casino offer with wagering requirements.\n\nHISTORY\nView your logged bets to keep track of your profits over time.\n\nCUSTOMISE APP ICON\nOption for either a light or dark app icon.\n\n*requires Premium Mode, available as an in-app purchase from Settings.\n\nDownload Matched Betting Calculators today - whether you are a novice or an experienced matched bettor, there is no easier way to calculate your lay stakes and profit on your mobile device. \n\n- - -\n\nDISCLAIMER\nAlthough every effort has been taken to ensure the accuracy of these calculators, you use them at your own risk and the developers shall not be held liable for any loss, financial or otherwise, resulting from this application's use or misuse.

  "description": "The \"Bingo at Home\" app is a bingo caller to play bingo at home, among family or friends.\n\nWhen a bingo game starts, the app begins to call the bingo balls. The game can be paused and restarted as needed, for example, to check if the line or bingo is correct, to check all the numbers already called, etc.\n\nThere are two game modes:\n\n- Automatic mode: The app begins to call the bingo balls until paused or until there are no more balls left. The app allows to configure the speed with which the balls are called.\n\n- Manual mode: The calling of the balls is made by tapping a button. Each time you tap the button, the app calls the next ball. If it is desired, you can silence the app so that the same person who is in charge of calling the balls is the one who announces the numbers.\n\nThe app can be used to play 90 balls bingo, the bingo variant that is played in Spain, and to play 75 balls bingo, the american bingo variant.\n\nIn the 90 balls bingo variant, the first one that completes a line is awarded with the line prize, and the first one that completes the whole bingo card is awarded with the bingo prize.\n\nIn the 75 balls bingo variant there is only one prize, the winner is the first who completes the shape currently in play in the bingo card. The app has several shapes to choose that you can complete. Every new game the shape changes, you can either start the game with this shape or select a new one.\n\nThe bingo cards to play at home can be printed for free from the Bingo.es website:\n\nhttp://www.bingo.es/cartones-bingo/ \n\nOr you can download our companion app \"Bingo Cards\" from:\n\nhttps://itunes.apple.com/es/app/cartones-de-bingo/id954591326",

Fully Game Center compatible, this is the most addictive and most realistic slot you will ever play outside of a casino.\n\nEnjoy full HD graphics and over 50 specially composed musical scores as you play the only slot simulator that has games of up to 100 lines. There is something for everyone, from beginner to veteran. And with hourly and daily bonuses and the opportunity to challenge players worldwide on Game Center, the fun literally never stops. Truly universal, it plays on all iOS devices.\n\nMultiplayer Tournament Mode\n\nThe best just got better. Born To Be Rich now includes a tournament mode, where you can play against your friends or find players from around the world in our unique ‘Matchmaker’ feature. Players compete for three minutes to see who can make the most credits. It’s fast, it’s furious, and it’s only on Born To Be Rich.\n\nThe Games\n\nIt’s what this app is famous for. We’ve received universal praise for the variety of games on offer.\n\nBorn to be Rich is our signature game. We love it so much we named the app after it. It has 5 reels and 30 lines and the aim of the game is to rack up luxury items. If you want to play the most exciting slots game ever, this one is for you.\n\nFluffy Dogs is a 5-reel game with 50 slots. Fast and frenetic, it’s a great way to cut your teeth with a basic slot machine.\n\nSmall Devils ups the ante with 5 reels and 1024 ways to win. This is the only app available anywhere that offers 1024 ways. \n\nMermaid Seas brings gorgeous visuals with 5 reels and 243 ways. And it’s quite possibly the best-looking slot app on your phone or iPad.\n\nCoffee Break is 25 lines and offers a multiplier free game feature.\n\nSpinning in Space has made history as the only 100-line slots game on iOS.\n\nClubbing Nights is a 30 line slot game with a unique and exciting increasing multiplier feature during free games. \n\nLa Patisserie is a 50 line slot game with different \"power-up\" wild symbols with special effects and massive payouts.\n\nThe features\n\nThis is what makes Born To Be Rich the only slots app you’ll ever need.\n\nIncredible hourly and daily bonuses\n\nThe app sends you push notifications when your bonuses come through, and these bonuses are huge too, so you never run out of credits, ever.\n\nSimulator\n\nFeel like the real deal? The simulator takes you one step closer to the casino, with authentic slots play, based on the actual mathematical processes that real machines use. It’s tough and not for beginners. If it’s too much for you, switch back to Arcade mode. We won’t tell anyone.\n\nAuto Spin\n\nThe machine will spin for you while you’re away from your phone or iPad doing something else. Perfect for racking up those scores.\n\nDouble Up\n\nPull in even bigger wins with Double Up. Guess the suit or color of the cards to win by doubling or quadrupling your score after a win. Hit a streak and who knows how much you’ll win…\n\n‘Career Curve’ feel with Max Bets\n\nIf you’re really a killer at the game, watch as your bet maximum increases as you win big. Experience what it’s like to play for truly high stakes.\n\nGame Center\n\nCompeittive?

  "description": "Increase your chances of winning the lottery with Lottery Balls. \n\nEver noticed how there's rollover after rollover without a winner and then multiple people hit the jackpot at the same time. There's a reason for that; people are all picking their numbers the same way. \n\nYou can beat this trend. Lottery Balls uses highly advanced randomising algorithms to find the numbers that other people aren't choosing. \n\nAs well as helping you win the top prize and not having to share it, Lottery Balls increases your chances of winning the smaller prizes. When using other random number generators, including the \"lucky dip\" available at retailers, each row of numbers will be produced in isolation. Using their method, if you're buying more than one ticket, you'll find you're repeating the same number on several lines. That's fine if all you're interested in is the jackpot, but for smaller prizes, you've got a better chance of winning if you cover a wider range of numbers. That's why Lottery Balls generates multiple lines holistically, without repeating any numbers across the different tickets. \n\nEver forgotten to buy your ticket? Lottery Balls can remind you on the day of the draw to go out and get it before it's too late. \n\nCheck results in the app and receive a notification to let you know when the draw has happened. Look up the results from previous draws. \n\nLike playing the same numbers every week? Lottery Balls can save your favorite numbers for quick and easy access every time. \n\nLottery Balls works with any lottery. We've even added built-in generation rules for many popular worldwide lotteries. \n\nThese include:\nEurope\nEuromillions\n\nAustralia\nPowerball\nMonday & Wednesday Lotto\nOz Lotto\nSet for Life\nTattsLotto (Saturday Lotto)\n\nCanada\nDaily Grand\nDaily Keno\nLottario\nLotto 649\nLotto Max\nPick-2\nPick-3\nPick-4\n\nChina\n七乐彩 (Lucky 7)\n七星彩 (Lucky 7)\n六合彩 (Mark Six Lottery)\n双色球 (Double Colour Ball)\n排列三 (Order of 3)\n排列五 (Order of 5)\n福彩3 D (3D Lottery)\n超级大乐透 (Super Lotto)\n\nSpain\nBonoloto\nEl Gordo\nLa Primitiva\n\nUnited Kingdom\nHealth Lottery\nLotto\nSet For Life\nThunderball\n\nIreland\nDaily Million\nLotto\n\nItaly\nSuperEnalotto\n\nJapan\nナンバーズ3 (Numbers3)\nナンバーズ4 (Numbers4)\nハロウィンジャンボ宝くじ (Jumbo Lottery)\nミニロト (Mini Loto)\nロト6 (Loto 6)\nロト7 (Loto 7)\n\nMexico\nChispazo\nMelate\nMelate Retro\n\nPhilippines\nGrand Lotto 6/55\nLotto 6/42\nMega Lotto 6/45\nSuper Lotto 6/49\nUltra Lotto 6/58\n\nSingapore\nTOTO\n\nTurkey\nSayisal Loto\nSüper Loto\n\nUSA\n2by2\nAll or Nothing\nCash 5\nCash4Life\nDaily Derby\nFantasy 5\nFlorida Lotto\nGimme 5\nJackpot Triple Play\nJersey Cash 5\nLotto America\nLucky Day Lotto\nLucky For Life\nMass Cash\nMega Millions\nMegabucks\nPick 2\nPick 3\nPick 4\nPick 5\nPowerball\nSuperLotto Plus\nTexas Two Step\n\nSouth Africa\nDAILY LOTTO\nLOTTO\nPowerBall\nUK 49\n\nWe’re adding more and more of these all the time and we’d love to hear your suggestions for what you’d like included.

I'll be clearing out the lottery closet and revealing the fake science behind many so-called 'lottery systems'.\n\nI'll also show you step-by-step exactly what you really can do to get the best chances of winning the lottery, and how to maximise your winnings.\n\nIt's truly amazing just how much money you can pay for a 'system' that gives you no better chance of winning the lottery than picking numbers at random. Are the sellers merely misguided, and don't really understand what they are selling - or something far worse altogether..?\n\nYou will be securely armed with the knowledge to see through the junk and false claims. You will be one of an exclusive, select group of people who actually play the lottery wisely (not many people do).\n\nYou can leap on the fast track to becoming lottery wise right here with my Free Lottery Tips course.

What does this mean? It means that this app works on all iPhone and iPad models. We welcome any feedback if you have problems with this app to our support group at info@getgreatmerchandise.com\n\nIt's a tool, it could be time consuming fun and enjoyment and it also provides the results of all of the New York Lottery games (NUMBERS, WIN4, TAKE5, LOTTO, MegaMillions, PowerBall, SweetMillions and the PICK10) and the current Jackpot Amounts for the MegaMillions, PowerBall and Lotto games.  We recently added a Hot Numbers section for the NUMBERS and WIN4 games. Just go the the screen and see what numbers have come out the most times in the past seven days. Scroll down the screen and see the top ten most popular numbers drawn since 1-19-2003.\n\nUse this App as a tool to analyze your numbers. See if they never came out or when they came out. See if your lucky numbers are hot or cold. The App provides the numbers and you decide if it is due to come out or not.\n\nUse this App for fun and enjoyment. Play by yourself or with friends. Pick the numbers and see if they came out recently or a while ago or if they never came out.

Pot Odds, Equity Drills, Shove/Fold Charts Trainer, Combinatorics are some of the training modules available in app for you to train. Train regularly and become the best poker player, ever!\n\nSome of the features include:\n\n- Beautiful charts, color coded so you can make your decisions quickly\n- EV of every single shove and/or call is shown so that you can base your decisions based on EV and avoid those marginal spots as an exploit!\n- Training Mode lets you train to improve on all situations.\n- Equity Calculator and Equity Drills lets you study equity calculations - hand vs hand, hand vs range, range vs hand and range vs range.\n- Training can be targeted for specific spots so you can choose what to train and what not to.\n- Easy to navigate and use.\n- Eye-friendly color schemes to use the app for long period of times.\n- No internet connection required and results are shown instantly as soon as you choose the spots!\n- 100% satisfaction guaranteed!\n\nWe are continously working on the app to keep it up-to-date.

We’ve combined the two! \n\n- Multiplayer Texas Hold’em Poker\n- Designed for live F2F poker\n- No wifi or bluetooth needed\n- Cross platform capability\n- Connect instantly with a game code\n- Provides both cards and chips\n- Free to play\n- Intuitive design\n- No credit card registration \n\nA DIFFERENT POKER APP\n\nEasyPoker is not your classic texas hold’em app. We are not a betting platform or an online casino. We don’t facilitate betting of real money. In fact we don’t use play money or chips. Just create a game and you're ready.\nWe think of EasyPoker as “just” a digital poker set - one that fits your pocket. EasyPoker is designed to simulate the experience of live poker. This means that you don’t have to compromise - even if you don’t have a physical poker set with you. \n\nEasyPoker’s mission is not to replace the physical poker set - if you have a deck of playing cards and poker chips, then by all means, use them. We would. \nInstead our purpose is to facilitate the same social experience of face to face poker, when you’re not around your classic poker set.\n\nEasyPoker is meant to be played live, and in the presence of good friends. \nAt its core, poker has always been a social experience, and we think it is best played face to face. Reading your opponents face is a big part of the classic game and we think this part is often lost with traditional online poker. After all, it’s called a “poker face”, and not a “poker avatar”. \n\nLET'S DO THIS TOGETHER\n\nEasyPoker is a relative small but fast moving team. We’re constantly testing and trying to improve our app and the experience of digital face to face poker. \nTherefore we’d love to hear any suggestions and wishes you might have. \nYou’ll find a neat suggestion box on our website https://easy.poker/. \n\nEASYPOKER+\n\nWith a Plus+ subscription you can play up to 12 people at a table, edit stacks, blinds, increasing blinds and accept rebuys.\n\nPlease notice that EasyPoker does not include any kind of real money gambling features.\n\n__________________________________________\n\nIf you choose to purchase EasyPoker Premium, payment will be charged to your iTunes account, and your account will be charged for renewal within 24-hours prior to the end of the current period. Auto-renewal may be turned off at any time by going to your settings in the iTunes Store after purchase. Current EasyPoker+ subscription price starts at $5.99 USD/month, and one-month, 6-month and 12-month packages are available.\n\nTerms of use: https://easy.poker/terms-conditions/",

In the game, players may choose to place roulette bets on either a single number or a range of numbers, the colors red or black, or whether the number is odd or even. The roulette odds are based on probability.\nTo determine the winning number and color, a croupier spins a wheel in one direction, then spins a ball in the opposite direction around a tilted circular track running around the circumference of the wheel. The ball eventually loses momentum and falls on to the wheel and into one of 37 (in French/European roulette) or 38 (in American roulette) colored and numbered pockets on the wheel.\nRoulette players have a variety of betting options. Placing inside roulette bets is either selecting the exact number of the pocket the ball will land in, or a small range of pockets based on their proximity on the layout. Players wishing to bet on the 'outside' will select roulette bets on larger positional groupings of pockets, the pocket color, or whether the winning number is odd or even. The payout roulette odds for each type of bet are based on its probability.\nThe roulette table usually imposes minimum and maximum bets, and these rules usually apply separately for all of a player's inside and outside roulette bets for each spin. For inside roulette bets at roulette tables, some casinos may use separate roulette table chips of various colors to distinguish players at the table. Players can continue to place roulette bets as the ball spins around the wheel until the dealer announces no more roulette bets.\nWhen a winning number and color is determined by the roulette wheel, the dealer will place a marker, also known as a dolly, on that winning number on the roulette table layout. When the dolly is on the table, no players may place roulette bets, collect roulette bets, or remove any roulette bets from the table. The dealer will then sweep away all other losing roulette bets either by hand or rake, and determine all of the payouts to the remaining inside and outside winning roulette bets. When the dealer is finished making payouts, the marker is removed from the roulette board where players collect their winnings and make new bets. The winning chips remain on the roulette board.\nRoulette wheel number sequence\nThe pockets of the roulette wheel are numbered from 1 to 36.\nIn number ranges from 1 to 10 and 19 to 28, odd numbers are red and even are black. In ranges from 11 to 18 and 29 to 36, odd numbers are black and even are red.\nThere is a green pocket numbered 0 (zero). In American roulette, there is a second green pocket marked 00.\n\n***\nFor more information on the game or the app in general, feel free to contact us.\n***\n\n***For Support and Feedback***\ncontact@phonato.com\nhttp://www.facebook.com/Phonato",

  "description": "Added daily bonus.\nWITH NEW BETS!!!\n\nRoulette - the most common game in casino. Excitement, the dynamics of games, fantastic prizes - all of this is based on its popularity around the world. It is attributed to various magical properties, the relationship with the devil, felt the finger of fate, etc. Maybe they are right - the sum of the numbers on the wheel = 666. \nDo not lose your head and just enjoy the game. \nThe rules are very simple: you put the chips of different value in the area of playing field and expect to drop the ball, which will specify the winning number. \nWe hope our software will give you a lot of fun. \nEnjoy the game!",

  "title": "Lottery Balls -  Lotto Results",
  "description": "Increase your chances of winning the lottery with Lottery Balls. \n\nEver noticed how there's rollover after rollover without a winner and then multiple people hit the jackpot at the same time. There's a reason for that; people are all picking their numbers the same way. \n\nYou can beat this trend. Lottery Balls uses highly advanced randomising algorithms to find the numbers that other people aren't choosing. \n\nAs well as helping you win the top prize and not having to share it, Lottery Balls increases your chances of winning the smaller prizes. When using other random number generators, including the \"lucky dip\" available at retailers, each row of numbers will be produced in isolation. Using their method, if you're buying more than one ticket, you'll find you're repeating the same number on several lines. That's fine if all you're interested in is the jackpot, but for smaller prizes, you've got a better chance of winning if you cover a wider range of numbers. That's why Lottery Balls generates multiple lines holistically, without repeating any numbers across the different tickets. \n\nEver forgotten to buy your ticket? Lottery Balls can remind you on the day of the draw to go out and get it before it's too late. \n\nCheck results in the app and receive a notification to let you know when the draw has happened. Look up the results from previous draws. \n\nLike playing the same numbers every week? Lottery Balls can save your favorite numbers for quick and easy access every time. \n\nLottery Balls works with any lottery. We've even added built-in generation rules for many popular worldwide lotteries. \n\nThese include:\nEurope\nEuromillions\n\nAustralia\nPowerball\nMonday & Wednesday Lotto\nOz Lotto\nSet for Life\nTattsLotto (Saturday Lotto)\n\nCanada\nDaily Grand\nDaily Keno\nLottario\nLotto 649\nLotto Max\nPick-2\nPick-3\nPick-4\n\nChina\n七乐彩 (Lucky 7)\n七星彩 (Lucky 7)\n六合彩 (Mark Six Lottery)\n双色球 (Double Colour Ball)\n排列三 (Order of 3)\n排列五 (Order of 5)\n福彩3 D (3D Lottery)\n超级大乐透 (Super Lotto)\n\nSpain\nBonoloto\nEl Gordo\nLa Primitiva\n\nUnited Kingdom\nHealth Lottery\nLotto\nSet For Life\nThunderball\n\nIreland\nDaily Million\nLotto\n\nItaly\nSuperEnalotto\n\nJapan\nナンバーズ3 (Numbers3)\nナンバーズ4 (Numbers4)\nハロウィンジャンボ宝くじ (Jumbo Lottery)\nミニロト (Mini Loto)\nロト6 (Loto 6)\nロト7 (Loto 7)\n\nMexico\nChispazo\nMelate\nMelate Retro\n\nPhilippines\nGrand Lotto 6/55\nLotto 6/42\nMega Lotto 6/45\nSuper Lotto 6/49\nUltra Lotto 6/58\n\nSingapore\nTOTO\n\nTurkey\nSayisal Loto\nSüper Loto\n\nUSA\n2by2\nAll or Nothing\nCash 5\nCash4Life\nDaily Derby\nFantasy 5\nFlorida Lotto\nGimme 5\nJackpot Triple Play\nJersey Cash 5\nLotto America\nLucky Day Lotto\nLucky For Life\nMass Cash\nMega Millions\nMegabucks\nPick 2\nPick 3\nPick 4\nPick 5\nPowerball\nSuperLotto Plus\nTexas Two Step\n\nSouth Africa\nDAILY LOTTO\nLOTTO\nPowerBall\nUK 49\n\nWe’re adding more and more of these all the time and we’d love to hear your suggestions for what you’d like included.

  "description": "matched betting |mætʃt bɛtɪŋ|: noun. 1. a bеtting technique used by individuals to profit from the free bets and incentives offered by bookmakers. It is generally considered risk-free as it is based on the application of a mathematical equation rather than chance.\n\nMatched Betting Calculators is a suite of tools to help you make as much money from bookmaker offers as possible. You can access the Normal, Stake Not Returned and Stake Returned calculators straight away - these will give you the tools to calculate the lay stakes required to lay (essentially betting on the opposite outcome) your qualifying and free bets to ensure risk-free cash.\n\nOnce you understand the basics, Matched Betting Calculators goes beyond other apps to offer you an advanced suite of tools to calculate lay stakes for more complex offers.\n\nThe full app provides:\n\nNORMAL CALCULATOR\nCalculate lay stakes for qualifying and arbitrage bets.\n\nSTAKE NOT RETURNED CALCULATOR\nCalculate lay stakes for free bets (stake not returned).\n\nSTAKE RETURNED CALCULATOR\nCalculate lay stakes for free bets (stake returned).\n\nODDS MATCH BAR\nQuickly view the closeness between your back and lay odds with the Odds Match Bar (available in Normal, SNR, Risk Free and Early Payout calculators).\n\nTRIGGER CALCULATOR*\nCalculate lay stakes for the initial and trigger bets when a free bet is provided after a certain condition is met (e.g., money back on losing correct score bets when a certain team wins).\n\nRISK FREE CALCULATOR*\nGuarantee a profit when there's money back as a free bet if your initial bet loses.\n\nEXTRA PLACE CALCULATOR*\nIf a bookmaker is paying more places in a race than the exchange, calculate your profit should your horse finish in the extra place.\n\nLAY SEQUENTIAL CALCULATOR*\nLay enhanced multiples when legs don't overlap - keep laying until one leg loses. If either the final leg loses or all legs win, you are in profit, otherwise it is risk-free.\n\nODDS BOOST CALCULATOR*\nGuarantee profit when bookmakers are offering boosted odds with extra winnings over the original odds are paid as a free bet.\n\nEARLY PAYOUT CALCULATOR*\nIf the bookmaker settles your bet as a winner early, guarantee profit by backing the original outcome again. Use the Cash Out slider to trade out part of your bet, while leaving the rest in play with potential for larger profit!\n\n2-WAY & 3-WAY DUTCH CALCULATORS*\nInstead of laying a bet, you can choose to cover all outcomes with back bets. Use these calculators to equalise profits when there are two or three mutually exclusive outcomes.\n\nFRACTIONAL TO DECIMAL CONVERTER\nQuickly convert fractional odds to decimal and copy them to the clipboard. Also see the implied chance of the outcome happening from the odds.\n\nQUICK LINKS\nAccess popular exchanges and bookmakers quickly from the app.\n\nSIMPLE EV TOOL\nCalculate the expected value of a casino offer with wagering requirements.\n\nHISTORY\nView your logged bets to keep track of your profits over time.\n\nCUSTOMISE APP ICON\nOption for either a light or dark app icon.\n\n*requires Premium Mode, available as an in-app purchase from Settings.\n\nDownload Matched Betting Calculators today - whether you are a novice or an experienced matched bettor, there is no easier way to calculate your lay stakes and profit on your mobile device. \n\n- - -\n\nDISCLAIMER\nAlthough every effort has been taken to ensure the accuracy of these calculators, you use them at your own risk and the developers shall not be held liable for any loss, financial or otherwise, resulting from this application's use or misuse.

  "description": "neu.Calc is an innovative financial/scientific calculator, which makes complex calculations much easier than traditional calculators or spreadsheet applications.\n\nAlso includes unit conversion and a programmer's calculator.\n\n◆ List - a series of numbers\n\nOne of the unique features of neu.Calc is the ability to deal with a series of numbers (list) directly.\n\nIf you want to calculate the average of a series of numbers, simply input the numbers a list, then tap the \"avg\" button.\n\n    (45, 55, 58, 62, 72, 80, 100) avg = 67.43\n\nIf you want to calculate the internal rate of return for a series of cash flows, input those numbers and tap the \"IRR\" button.\n\n    (-1000, 300, 300, 300, 300) IRR = 0.0771\n\n◆ Label and references\n\nEach time the \"=\" button is used, neu.Calc creates a formula. Each formula is automatically labeled (M1, M2, M3, ..., ) and can be referenced by other formulas. To reference an existing formula, tap on it in the sheet. Labels can be changed by tapping on the label to the left of the formula, when the formula is being entered or edited.\n\nM1: 45, 55, 58, 62, 72, 80, 100 = 45, 55, 58, 62, 72, 80, 100\nM2: M1 avg = 67.43\nM3: M1 sum = 472.00\nM4: M1 stdev = 16.97\nM5: 60, 52, 50, 70, 100, 74, 95 = 60, 52, 50, 70, 100, 74, 95\nM6: M1 correl M5 = 0.75\n\nHere is another example.\n\nM1: -1000 = -1000\nM2: 300 = 300\nM3: M1, M2 rep 4 = -1000, 300, 300, 300, 300\nM4: 6 % = 0.06\nM5: M3 NPV M4 = 39.53\n\n◆ Solver\n\nSolver is a powerful tool to solve linear equations. In order to solve an equation, you need to first create a formula for an unknown value with an estimate, and create a formula (or formulas) that represents the equation.\n\nHere is a simple example to solve the equation \"x * 2.5 = 100\", where the estimate is 10.\n\nM1: 10 = 10.00\nM2: M1 * 2.5 - 100 = -75.00\n\nIn order to get the appropriate value for M1 (x in the original equation) that makes the result of M2 zero, tap the \"Edit\" button of M1, then the \"Solve\" button of M2. You'll get the following result.\n\nM1: 40.00 = 40.00\nM2: M1 * 2.5 - 100 = 0.00\n\nTo demonstrate a more complex case, take a look at the NPV example again.\n\nM1: -1000 = -1000\nM2: 300 = 300\nM3: M1, M2 rep 4 = -1000, 300, 300, 300, 300\nM4: 6 % = 0.06\nM5: M3 NPV M4 = 39.53\n\nIf you want to know the minimum yearly income to justify this investment, tap the \"edit\" button of M2, and tap the \"solve\" button of M5. You'll get this.\n\nM1: -1000 = -1000\nM2: 288.59 = 288.59\nM3: M1, M2 rep 4 = -1000, 288.59, 288.59, 288.59, 288.59\nM4: 6 % = 0.06\nM5: M3 NPV M4 = 0.00",

Because we've done away with them, we can offer some of the most competitive spreads around. And not as opening offers or discounts, but permanently.\nBring your edge to Core Spreads and trade for less. \n \nTrade without the noise\nThe platform for those who already know their edge. No bells, no whistles – just a simple, noise-free way to trade.\nNo distractions, no clutter – no republished newsfeeds or analyst reports, no learn-to-trade tutorials or expert opinions from people in braces.

  "description": "Oovium makes my geek heart flutter.\n- Anne Wind \n\nThis app is a thing of beauty. \n- W Smith Jr \n\nWow I love this \n- OkeyMor57 \n\n22nd century calculating \n- bill knighton \n\nThis will become Hari Seldon’s Prime Radiant some day. \n- nicked off \n\nOovium is not an attempt to rehash old outdated inventions, but it subsumes much of their functionality. The calculator, spreadsheet, concept map, programming language: Oovium is all of them and it's none of them. \n\nOovium is the first (but certainly not the last) of an entirely new class of app, the calculation sandbox. It has been made possible by the invention of the touch device and Oovium's clean, efficient and tactile interface, designed for such devices, has been part of its DNA since its inception. \n\nAt its heart, Oovium aspires to make powerful, sophisticated and complex abilities (such as those currently available only to programmers) accessible to a wider audience. Oovium understands that increasing accessibility does not mean dumbing down an application by hiding complex functionality, it means making that complex functionality understandable by creating explicit visual representations for it. \n\nThe workspace of Oovium is a two-dimensional surface known as the Aether. Upon this aether a user can place Bubbles. There are currently four types of bubbles: \n- InstBub is an instance of an object, usually a number, which in turn may be the result of an expression. \n- MechBub allows the user to define their own functions. \n- GridBub allows for a tabular arrangement of numbers and expressions similar to a spreadsheet. \n- TextBub is a node that can be connected to other TextBub nodes in order to create concept maps. \n\nThese bubbles can be connected to each other in order to render sophisticated calculations in a visual (and aesthetic) way. Libraries of custom functions can be developed and included in other aethers when needed. \n\nThe concept of Oovium has six different aspects; in its current form it contains only one of these six aspects. It is a highly ambitious project with much more planned, that hopes to empower users; it hopes to change the way people think about and work with their computers; in short, it hopes to change the world! Come help drive its functionality; come help make Oovium happen!",
