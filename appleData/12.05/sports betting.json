The more you know, the more you win, and the best part is, you’re beating your friends, not the bookmakers.\n\nWho Knows Wins are the pioneers of Social betting. The idea is simple.\n\nA league is set up containing a number of sporting fixtures, and all you have to do is make your predictions on the outcomes of these fixtures.\n\nFor every correct selection, you gain a point, and the more points you gain, the more chance you’ll have of winning.\n\nEach league has an entry stake and the pot distribution is set out before the league begins.\n\nSo invite your friends to join you, sit back, and if you know the sport like you say you do, prepare to rake in all your friend's cash. Modesty is optional, arrogance compulsory.\n\nKey Features\n\n- Play against friends\n- Face Recognition, touch ID, PIN login\n\n- Real money\n\n- Chat section\n\n- Live score updates\n\n\nThis is a real money gambling app. Please gamble responsibly and only bet what you can afford.

  "description": "matched betting |mætʃt bɛtɪŋ|: noun. 1. a bеtting technique used by individuals to profit from the free bets and incentives offered by bookmakers. It is generally considered risk-free as it is based on the application of a mathematical equation rather than chance.\n\nMatched Betting Calculators is a suite of tools to help you make as much money from bookmaker offers as possible. You can access the Normal, Stake Not Returned and Stake Returned calculators straight away - these will give you the tools to calculate the lay stakes required to lay (essentially betting on the opposite outcome) your qualifying and free bets to ensure risk-free cash.\n\nOnce you understand the basics, Matched Betting Calculators goes beyond other apps to offer you an advanced suite of tools to calculate lay stakes for more complex offers.\n\nThe full app provides:\n\nNORMAL CALCULATOR\nCalculate lay stakes for qualifying and arbitrage bets.\n\nSTAKE NOT RETURNED CALCULATOR\nCalculate lay stakes for free bets (stake not returned).\n\nSTAKE RETURNED CALCULATOR\nCalculate lay stakes for free bets (stake returned).\n\nODDS MATCH BAR\nQuickly view the closeness between your back and lay odds with the Odds Match Bar (available in Normal, SNR, Risk Free and Early Payout calculators).\n\nTRIGGER CALCULATOR*\nCalculate lay stakes for the initial and trigger bets when a free bet is provided after a certain condition is met (e.g., money back on losing correct score bets when a certain team wins).\n\nRISK FREE CALCULATOR*\nGuarantee a profit when there's money back as a free bet if your initial bet loses.\n\nEXTRA PLACE CALCULATOR*\nIf a bookmaker is paying more places in a race than the exchange, calculate your profit should your horse finish in the extra place.\n\nLAY SEQUENTIAL CALCULATOR*\nLay enhanced multiples when legs don't overlap - keep laying until one leg loses. If either the final leg loses or all legs win, you are in profit, otherwise it is risk-free.\n\nODDS BOOST CALCULATOR*\nGuarantee profit when bookmakers are offering boosted odds with extra winnings over the original odds are paid as a free bet.\n\nEARLY PAYOUT CALCULATOR*\nIf the bookmaker settles your bet as a winner early, guarantee profit by backing the original outcome again. Use the Cash Out slider to trade out part of your bet, while leaving the rest in play with potential for larger profit!\n\n2-WAY & 3-WAY DUTCH CALCULATORS*\nInstead of laying a bet, you can choose to cover all outcomes with back bets. Use these calculators to equalise profits when there are two or three mutually exclusive outcomes.\n\nFRACTIONAL TO DECIMAL CONVERTER\nQuickly convert fractional odds to decimal and copy them to the clipboard. Also see the implied chance of the outcome happening from the odds.\n\nQUICK LINKS\nAccess popular exchanges and bookmakers quickly from the app.\n\nSIMPLE EV TOOL\nCalculate the expected value of a casino offer with wagering requirements.\n\nHISTORY\nView your logged bets to keep track of your profits over time.\n\nCUSTOMISE APP ICON\nOption for either a light or dark app icon.\n\n*requires Premium Mode, available as an in-app purchase from Settings.\n\nDownload Matched Betting Calculators today - whether you are a novice or an experienced matched bettor, there is no easier way to calculate your lay stakes and profit on your mobile device. \n\n- - -\n\nDISCLAIMER\nAlthough every effort has been taken to ensure the accuracy of these calculators, you use them at your own risk and the developers shall not be held liable for any loss, financial or otherwise, resulting from this application's use or misuse. Please ensure betting is legal in your jurisdiction before placing any bets and you are of the required age.",
