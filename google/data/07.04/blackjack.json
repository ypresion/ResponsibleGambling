With the new skills you pick up you’ll feel more confident for your next trip to Vegas!\r\n\r\nA note regarding the odds of winning Blackjack free:\r\n\r\nLike all casino games, the odds of winning are slightly in favor of the casino. In our game, we use a cryptographically strong randomizer to shuffle the decks to make the game as authentic as possible. The game of blackjack is not meant to be ‘won’ but is instead a game of both strategy and chance, resulting in both wins and losses. The unfavorable hands are meant to make the following winning streaks that much sweeter :)\r\n\r\nBlackjack 21 Rules: \r\n\r\nBlackjack, also known as 21, is one of the most popular casino games in the world. Blackjack is a card game where players compete against the dealer. The object of the game is to reach 21 or to reach a score higher than the dealer without exceeding 21. \r\n\r\nIn Blackjack free by Brainium, the dealer must draw to 16 and stand on soft 17. Blackjack pays 3 to 2, and insurance pays 2 to 1. \r\n\r\nBlackjack 21 Highlights & Features: \r\n\r\n- Gorgeous, beautifully animated cards \r\n- Touch and interact with all of your chips \r\n- Split hands or double down to win big \r\n- Buy insurance to dodge a dealer blackjack \r\n- Surrender to get out of a tough situation \r\n- Detailed statistics to track your performance \r\n- Multiple casino table backdrops to choose from \r\n- Unlimited dealer hints \r\n- Unlimited free chips! Just spin the wheel :)\r\n- New deck animation helps you practice your card counting skills\r\n- Our Blackjack free games look amazing on tablets and phones of all sizes\r\n\r\nIf you enjoy our black jack App, check out our other card games, Solitaire, Spider Solitaire, and FreeCell, on Google Play or AppBrain.\r\n\r\nWe hope you enjoy Blackjack free by Brainium, and contact our five star support if you have any questions :)",

You're crossing your fingers for an Ace + 10.\r\n\r\nTWENTY-ONE: A 21 consists of more than two cards that equal twenty-one.

  "title": "Blackjack free offline card games no wifi trainer",
  "description": "Blackjack also known as Blackjack 21 is the world's most popular card games. The game is free and works without wifi or internet connection. \r\n\r\nThe goal of the game is to beat the dealer in one of the following ways:\r\n\r\n🔴 Get 21 points on the player's first two cards (called a \"blackjack\" or \"natural\"), without a dealer blackjack; \r\n\r\n🔴 Reach a final score higher than the dealer without exceeding 21; or\r\n\r\n🔴 Let the dealer draw additional cards until their hand exceeds 21 (\"busted\").\r\n\r\nBets and Chips\r\n\r\nIn the first place, toward the beginning of each round, you should make a BET. It tends to be somewhere in the range of $1 to All In. By clicking your chips of proper value, you put down your wager on the table (you can tap the wager on the table to take the chips back). When cards are dealt, wagers can't be changed until the following round.\r\nThe \"All-In\" button will wager all your money at once.\r\n\r\nDEAL\r\n\r\nWhen a wager is made, click DEAL. The dealer will give you two cards, which form your HAND, and two cards to themselves. One of the seller's cards will be covered up at first. To win, you have to guarantee the consolidated sum of your cards is greater than that of the dealer.\r\n\r\nHit and Stand\r\n\r\nYou can add more cards, one by one, by choosing to HIT, but be wary: you must never exceed 21. Whoever gets more than 21 loses automatically. Once you’re ready to play the hand, click STAND. Dealer will then reveal their hidden card, and must always Hit if they have 16 or lower. When they have 17 or more, they will stop hitting.\r\n\r\nCard Value\r\n\r\nThe value of an ace can be either 1 or 11 to give you the best possible combination. All the faces are worth 10 each, and other cards are worth their face value. \r\n\r\nWinning\r\n\r\nThe one who gets 21, wins! A tie is termed as a PUSH and will refund the wager to the player. If you get over 21 then you get a BUST which is an instant loss. \r\n\r\nYou can also win if the dealer gets over 21, or if you get a higher value than the dealer. Getting 21 on your first two cards is called a \"Blackjack\" or a \"natural\" and beats any combination of the dealer. A normal win will give you 2x of your wager and a blackjack will give you 2.5x of your wager.\r\n\r\nDouble and Split\r\n\r\nYou can also \"DOUBLE\" your wager once cards are dealt. The dealer cannot \"DOUBLE\". Once you tap \"DOUBLE\" you can take exactly one more card, and then immediately Stand.\r\nYou can also \"SPLIT\" if you get two cards of the same value.\r\n\r\n\"SPLITTING\" gets you two hands, each with a wager equal to your initial wager. Then you can play normally with both the hands. You can \"SPLIT\" again if possible, up to 3 times a deal.\r\n\r\nInsurance\r\n\r\nInsurance is a side bet that the dealer has blackjack and is treated independently of the main wager. It pays 2:1 (meaning that the player receives two dollars for every dollar bet) and is available when the dealer's exposed card is an ace.\r\n\r\nChanging the rules\r\n\r\nYou can change the following game rules:\r\n🔴 Dealer \"HITTING\" or not \"HITTING\" on a soft 17 (when they have a value of 17 with an Ace+6)?\r\n🔴 Number of decks.\r\n🔴 Allowing Insurance?\r\n🔴 Automatic wager equal to you last one?\r\n\r\nHint\r\n\r\nTap on \"HINT\"  to get a hint from the dealer. \r\n\r\nCashOut and Score\r\n\r\nTapping CashOut will end your game.\r\n\r\nThis app can also be used as a Blackjack trainer app which could help you in your real money games. Hope you enjoy playing Blackjack ! 😀",

  "description": "BLACKJACK (Blackjack 21) download and play a new, free game. You can play without the Internet - offline.\r\nOne of the most popular card games in casinos around the world.\r\nThe great popularity of the game is determined by simple rules, the speed of the game and the simplest strategy in counting cards.\r\nThe rules of the game BLACKJACK (Blackjack 21).\r\nFirst, the player receives two cards “open”, the sum of the points of which allows you to decide whether he needs additional cards or not. The goal of the game is to score 21 points or an amount close to this. If a player scores a total of points in excess of 21, then his bet loses. If the amount of points on the dealer’s cards is more than 21, then all bets remaining in the game win.\r\nPlayers who score more than the dealer points win, their bets are paid 1: 1.\r\nPlayers who score less than the dealer lose.\r\nIf the player’s total is equal to the dealer’s total, then a “draw” or Stay is declared: the player’s bet does not win or lose.\r\nThe dealer collects the cards last, while he is obliged to take the card if he has 16 points or less, and stop if the sum of points is 17 or more. Aces count as 1 or 11, “pictures” (jacks, ladies and kings) - all 10 points each, the rest of the cards correspond to their face value.\r\n\r\nBLACKJACK (BLACKJACK)\r\nThis is a combination on the first two cards from the deal, giving a total of 21 points (ace and ten or ace and “picture”). In this case, the player’s bets are paid 3: 2, if the dealer does not have the same combination. Blackjack wins any other combination of cards, including combinations with an amount equal to 21 points.\r\n\r\nSURRENDER\r\nAfter the first two cards are dealt, the player may refuse to continue the game, losing half of the corresponding bets. This can be done before the third card, on which they want to make SURRENDER. A player cannot make SURRENDER if the dealer's first card is an ace.\r\n\r\nSPLIT\r\nIf the first two cards of a player are of the same denomination, that is, they have the same value for points, then they can be divided. At the same time, the player makes an additional bet on this box, equal to the original one, and draws cards for each card separately. All pairs of identical cards can be divided no more than three times. The exception is aces. Splitting aces is allowed twice, and when splitting a player receives only one card for each of the aces. The combination of Ace and Ten (picture), obtained after the separation, is considered as 21 and is not a Blackjack combination.\r\nDOUBLE DOWN\r\nAfter the player has received the first two cards, regardless of the number of points, he can double his bet, while receiving only one card. Doubling after splitting cards is allowed. If the player has 9, 10 and 11 points, then the dealer will always offer to double the player’s bid.\r\n\r\nINSURANCE (INSURANCE)\r\nIf the dealer’s first card is an ace, the player can make an additional bet, but not more than half of the amount of the initial bets and not less than half of the minimum table, placing it on the field marked Insurance. This bet wins if the dealer drops Blackjack and is paid 2: 1, in all other cases it loses.\r\n\r\nThe difference between the Russian version of the game \"Point\" and \"BlackJack 21\".\r\nA point, also called twenty-one point, or just twenty-one - the Russian version of the card game, known in many countries.\r\nThis game is similar to the blackjack version of the game, which can be played with a standard Russian deck (36 cards) instead of a full standard deck (54 cards), since at that time a deck of 36 cards was common, and decks of 52 and 54 cards were rare.\r\nUnlike blackjack, the values ​​of the cards J (jack), Q (queen) and K (king) are not 10, but 1, 2 and 3, respectively, which partially compensates for the absence of cards from two to five. But, since the number of cards with a value of 10 is significantly less than in blackjack, the game balance is very different. Ace 11. King 3. Queen 2. Jack 1.",

  "description": "Blackjack, also known as Twenty-one or Vingt-et-un (French: \"twenty-one\"), is the most widely played casino banking game in the world. Blackjack is a comparing card game between a player and dealer and played with one or more French decks of 52 cards.\r\nThe player is dealt an initial two card hand with the option of drawing cards to bring the total value to 21 or less without exceeding it, so that the dealer will lose by having a lesser hand than the player or by exceeding 21. Since the 1960s, blackjack has been a high profile target of advantage players, particularly card counters, who track the profile of cards yet to be dealt, and adapt their wager and playing strategy accordingly. While in our implementation we do not teach counting, we do offer basic strategy hints to train you on how to improve your odds.\r\nMany rule variations of BlackJack exist. Our implementation offers most common casino rules:\r\n- Play with 4 decks\r\n- Decks are reshuffled when there is less than 20 cards left.\r\n- Dealer stands on soft 17\r\n- Player can split twice\r\n- Neither surrender nor insurance are offered\r\nWhen hints are enabled, player would need to confirm his choice if it's not the most optimum action.\r\nWhen you running short on credits, feel free to use our build in slot machine - truly the loosest slots in town!\r\nDon't forget to check our Game section for other fun games...",

A 10 of Spade counts as 10, 5 of Heart counts as 5 etc.\r\nThe face cards Jack, Queen, King count as 10 points each. \r\nAn Ace can count both as 1 and 11. \r\n\r\nIt is possible to split a hand of cards when both cards have the same value (for example 9 of Hearts and 9 of Spades).\r\nAfter a split both hands can win independent of each other.\r\n\r\nJust as in a real vegas casino you can choose to \"double down\".

The problem with most of the BlackJack or 21 card counting simulators is they are based on a single player against the dealer. In a real game of BlackJack or 21 the player would not only need to keep up with his own cards but also all cards that have been dealt. BlackJack Trainer solves this by simulating a game with five players and the dealer. \r\n\r\nTo better simulate different BlackJack or 21 game formats you can change several settings:\r\nPlay up to 5 Blackjack hands\r\nSet number of decks in the shoe\r\nDeck Penetration percentage\r\nOverall Game Speed\r\nSet Blackjack players starting bank \r\nSet Blackjack table minimum\r\nSet Blackjack table maximum\r\nShow Blackjack card counting statistics\r\nShow suggested Blackjack or 21 advice\r\nChoose from several Blackjack or 21 card counting methods\r\nChoose from several Blackjack or 21 strategies including Basic Strategy\r\n\r\n\r\nBlackjack Strategies currently included:\r\n\r\nBasic Single Deck -- Basic Strategy for use when playing single deck \r\nBlackJack 21\r\nBasic Multi-Deck -- Basic Strategy for use when playing multi-deck Blackjack 21\r\nAggressive Multi-Deck -- A very aggressive custom Blackjack 21 strategy with high variance\r\nSmart Multi-Deck - A less aggressive custom Blackjack 21 strategy that weights decisions according to current card count\r\n  \r\n\r\nCount Methods included\r\n\r\nHigh-Low - Most commonly used Blackjack 21 card counting method\r\nCanfield Expert - Made popular in the book \"Blackjack Your Way to Riches\".

  "description": "Spanish 21 is a variation of blackjack, that in some cases is the best bet in the casino. In locations where the dealer stands on a soft 17, or redoubling is allowed, Spanish 21 may be a better bet than blackjack, depending on the specific blackjack rules. If you are looking for a change of pace from traditional blackjack but insist on a game with a low house edge, then you may find new excitement in Spanish 21.\r\n\r\nKey feature: \r\n\r\n* Gorgeous HD graphics and slick, fast gameplay\r\n* Realistic sounds, and smooth animations\r\n* Fast and clean interface.\r\n* Offline playable: you dont need an internet connection to play this game, it run perfectly fine when offline\r\n* Constant playing: you don't need to wait for other player to play this game\r\n* Completely free: you don't need any money to play this game, the chips in the game are also free to get.\r\n\r\nHere are the full rules of the game.\r\n\r\nSpanish 21 uses six or eight Spanish decks, each deck consisting of 48 cards — the regular 52 cards less the four tens. Any card counter can tell you that removing any 10-point card from the cards moves the odds in favor of the dealer. To make up for this, Spanish 21 gives the player a host of bonuses and favorable rules. There are lots of Spanish 21 games all over the country, so rules will vary somewhat from place to place, but the usual rules in the player's favor are:\r\n\r\n+ Late surrender allowed.\r\n+ Double after split allowed.\r\n+ Re-splitting aces allowed.\r\n+ A player 21 always wins.\r\n+ Player blackjack beats dealer blackjack.\r\n+ Player may double on any number of cards.\r\n+ Player may usually hit and double down after splitting aces.\r\n+ Player may surrender after doubling, known as \"double down rescue.\" The player forfeits an amount equal to his original bet.\r\n+ A five-card 21 pays 3 to 2, a six-card 21 pays 2 to 1, a seven or more card 21 pays 3 to 1. Bonus not honored after doubling.\r\n+ A 6-7-8 or 7-7-7 of mixed suits pays 3 to 2, of the same suit pays 2 to 1, and of spades pays 3 to 1. These bonuses do not pay after doubling.\r\n+ Suited 7-7-7 when the dealer has a seven face up pays $1000 for bets of $5-$24 and $5000 \"Super Bonus\" for bets of $25 or over. In addition, all other players receive a $50 \"envy bonus.\" This bonus does not pay after doubling or splitting.\r\n\r\n\r\nDownload Spanish 21 now for free!\r\n\r\nBlue Wind casino\r\nBring the casino to your home",

  "description": "Blackjack, also known to some as twenty-one, is one of the most popular casino games around - and also super simple to learn! This easy to use, simple Blackjack game will certainly become your new favorite on your mobile!\r\n\r\nBlackjack is a card game that pits player versus dealer. It is played with one or more decks of cards. Cards are counted as their respective numbers, face cards as ten, and ace as either eleven or one (in our game it will show on the counter as an 11 unless you are over 21). The object of Blackjack is the beat the dealer. This can be accomplished by getting Blackjack (first two cards equal 21) without dealer Blackjack, having your final card count be higher than the dealers without exceeding 21, or by not exceeding 21 and dealer busting by exceeding their card count of 21.",

  "description": "No! The object of blackjack is to beat the dealer. \r\n\r\nTo beat the dealer the player must first not bust (go over 21) and second either outscore the dealer or have the dealer bust.\r\n\r\nKey feature: \r\n\r\n* Gorgeous HD graphics and slick, fast gameplay\r\n* Realistic sounds, and smooth animations\r\n* Fast and clean interface.\r\n* Offline playable: you dont need an internet connection to play this game, it run perfectly fine when offline\r\n* Constant playing: you don't need to wait for other player to play this game\r\n* Completely free: you don't need any money to play this game, the chips in the game are also free to get.\r\n\r\nHere are the full rules of the game.\r\n\r\n+ Casino Blackjack may be played with one to eight decks of 52-card decks.\r\n\r\n+ Aces may be counted as 1 or 11 points, 2 to 9 according to pip value, and tens and face cards count as ten points.\r\n\r\n+ The value of a hand is the sum of the point values of the individual cards. Except, a \"blackjack\" is the highest hand, consisting of an ace and any 10-point card, and it outranks all other 21-point hands.\r\n\r\n+ After the players have bet, the dealer will give two cards to player and two cards to himself. One of the dealer cards is dealt face up. The facedown card is called the \"hole card.\"\r\n\r\n+ If the dealer has an ace showing, he will offer a side bet called \"insurance.\" This side wager pays 2 to 1 if the dealer's hole card is any 10-point card. Insurance wagers are optional and may not exceed half the original wager.\r\n\r\n+ If the dealer has a ten or an ace showing (after offering insurance with an ace showing), then he will peek at his facedown card to see if he has a blackjack. If he does, then he will turn it over immediately.\r\n\r\n+ If the dealer does have a blackjack, then all wagers (except insurance) will lose, unless the player also has a blackjack, which will result in a push. The dealer will resolve insurance wagers at this time.\r\n\r\n+ Play begins with the player to the dealer's left. The following are the choices available to the player: \r\nStand: Player stands pat with his cards.\r\n\r\n\t+ Hit: Player draws another card (and more if he wishes). If this card causes the player's total points to exceed 21 (known as \"breaking\" or \"busting\") then he loses.\r\n\r\n\t+ Double: Player doubles his bet and gets one, and only one, more card.\r\n\r\n\t+ Split: If the player has a pair, or any two 10-point cards, then he may double his bet and separate his cards into two individual hands. The dealer will automatically give each card a second card. Then, the player may hit, stand, or double normally. However, when splitting aces, each ace gets only one card. Sometimes doubling after splitting is not allowed. If the player gets a ten and ace after splitting, then it counts as 21 points, not a blackjack. \r\n\r\n\t+ Surrender: The player forfeits half his wager, keeping the other half, and does not play out his hand. This option is only available on the initial two cards\r\n\r\n+ After each player has had his turn, the dealer will turn over his hole card. If the dealer has 16 or less, then he will draw another card. A special situation is when the dealer has an ace and any number of cards totaling six points (known as a \"soft 17\"). At some tables, the dealer will also hit a soft 17.\r\n\r\n+ If the dealer goes over 21 points, then any player who didn't already bust will win.\r\n\r\n+ If the dealer does not bust, then the higher point total between the player and dealer will win.\r\n\r\n+ Winning wagers pay even money, except a winning player blackjack pays 3 to 2.\r\n\r\nDownload Casino Blackjack now for free!\r\n\r\nBlue Wind casino\r\nBring the casino to your home",

  "description": "This Blackjack game developed as part of an assignment at Lorain County Community College (LCCC).\r\n\r\nThe Blackjack online game uses six decks of cards and gives the online player five hundred chips.  The online player uses the slider to identify the amount of the placed bet and to reduce the available chips accordingly. When the online player presses the Play button, the online player and the dealer receive two cards.  The online player cards are both face up.  The dealer receives one card face up and one card face down. This Blackjack game gives the online player options to Hit (take another card) or Stand (keep the cards that have been dealt) as happens at a Casino.  \r\n\r\nThe dealer flips the card turned faced down when the online player presses the Stand button or when the first two dealer cards equal exactly 21 points. The dealer player follows simple rules. A dealer takes a hit (receives a card) on 16 points or lower. A dealer stands on 17 points or greater.  The dealer takes no hit when the game declares a bust for the online player.\r\n\r\nThe game declares a Win (higher score), Bust (loss of game), or Push (equal score) for the online player based on the highest score equal to or less than 21 between the player and dealer. Game automatically declares a winner when the dealer and/or the player have 21 points with the first two cards that are dealt.  Game automatically declares a Win or Push when a player reaches 21 points.  Game automatically declares a Bust (loss of game) when a player goes over 21.\r\n\r\nGame declares a Win, Bust, or Push when the online player presses the Stand button. Game declares a Win when the online player has a higher score than the dealer or when the Dealer goes over 21 points. Game declares a Bust when the online player has a lower score than the dealer. Game declares a Push when the player and the dealer have the same score.  \r\n\r\nIn the case of a Push the player receives chips equal to the placed bet. In the case of a Win the online player receives the chips equal to the bet plus an equal amount of chips based on the bet. If the player receives a Win based on Blackjack (exactly 21 points), the player receives the chips equal to the bet plus two times the amount of chips based on the bet. In the case of a Bust the player loses the chips equal to the bet.",

In this original puzzle game you must get the most points from a deck of cards by making columns that add up to 21.\r\n\r\nThis is NOT a gambling game. It is a solo puzzle game inspired by crossing Solitaire and Patience with the scoring system of Blackjack.\r\n\r\n♠️ HOW TO PLAY ♠️\r\nTake one card at a time from the deck, and assign it to a column. Attempt to make the sum of the cards add to twentyone, but don’t go over.\r\n\r\nBetween getting a new card, you may choose to hit ‘Stay’ to take the points, or you can take a chance and draw the next card.\r\n\r\nAces are worth 1 or 11 points. Getting a Twenty-one is worth double points, getting a Blackjack (a Twenty-one with only 2 cards) is triple points!\r\n\r\nThe goal: Get the most points with a deck of 52 cards.\r\n\r\n♠️ FEATURES ♠️\r\n● Excitement: Just the right mix of skill along with the thrill of getting lucky, but without a gambling component. \r\n● Depth: Unlock new rules that allow you to earn more points and get even higher scores.\r\n● Compete: See how you measure up on the leaderboard.

  "description": "Black jack is played against casinos, the casino site. Whether you are alone on the table or connected by people from all over the world, there is no connection between you and other players. Everyone plays their own game against the kas.\r\n\r\nWHAT IS THE POINT?\r\n\r\nBlackjack is also aiming to make the right moves and reach the nearest number to 21 in total with your papers. Before crossing 21.\r\n\r\nPAPER VALUES\r\n\r\nIn the vote all the Priest, Girl and Vale papers are worth 10. A (As) is 1 or 11 according to your use and advantage. All other papers are of their own value.\r\n\r\nGAME RULES\r\n\r\nThe game moves in the following way:\r\n\r\n* Two cards are dealt to each player and the kas.\r\n* When the cards are dealt, if the player is already in the game or in the casinos, it will automatically win the game, which is called \"Blackjack\". If no one else has 21:\r\n* The player sees a single sheet of the carousel and moves according to the options presented to him. These options are:\r\n- HIT (Card Check) - Player draws one more paper in addition to his hand. In this way he tries to get closer to 21, and if he presses Hit again, he can draw as much paper as he wants. (But it automatically loses after 21)\r\n- STAND - If the player accepts the sheets as they are, or if they have moved in advance and no longer want to draw another, they click on the stand. Thus, it gives the movement to the crotch. (There is a movement that Kasan has to make obligatory, you will find these below, so the stand option is sometimes the right move)\r\n- SPLIT - The player splits the cards in his hand into two separate hands and plays with two separate hands. The second hand puts the same amount as the first one. For example, let's say that the player comes in two hands of Ace. Their sum is 2. The most logical move in such a case is Split. The player makes these two pieces of Ace Split and divides them into two pieces and turns them into two separate pieces of Ace. According to the paper that comes with them when the Ases are two separate hands, you will have a look at 2 of them in your hand suddenly, or at least you can come up with beautiful combinations.\r\n\r\nMANDATORY MOVEMENTS OF THE BODY\r\n\r\nWhen 21 cards are dealt cards, if there are a total of 17 or more points in the hand of the cradle, they have to make a STAND. If you have 16 or a lower number, you have to do HIT, that is, to draw paper. These two mandatory rules often give us great tactical advantages.",

  "title": "Chinese Blackjack -  Ban Luck",
  "description": "Play as a dealer in this unique Blackjack variant: Chinese Blackjack\r\n\r\nIn South East Asia it is extremely popular during the Chinese New Year and can be found in many casinos. Chinese Blackjack is also known as 21-point, Ban-Nag, Ban Luck or Ban-Luk depending on the various localities where the game is found.\r\n\r\nThe resemblance of Chinese Blackjack to standard blackjack is very evident in the basic rules of the game and how the cards are dealt. Beyond this basic similarity, however, are several key differences which make Chinese Blackjack a fun and challenging betting game.\r\n\r\nChinese Blackjack Rules and How to Play\r\n\r\nWhile many of the Chinese Blackjack rules are the same as those adhered to in standard versions of blackjack, there are also differences which make this particular variation unique. Chinese Blackjack features its own winning combinations, those being ban-ban, ban-nag, free hand and 5-Dragon.\r\n\r\nA player holding two Aces has a ban-ban, which pays out 3:1, unless the dealer has a ban-ban. This results in a push.\r\nA player holding an Ace and a card with a value of 10 has a ban-nag, which pays out 2:1. If the dealer has a ban-nag, he beats out all hands, except a ban-ban.\r\n A player holding a total of 15 has a free hand. This allows the player to continue or stop playing that hand. The same rule applies to the dealer. If the dealer chooses to stop playing, the hand ends and the dealer re-shuffles the cards.\r\n If the player holds five cards without busting, he has a 5-Dragon. He is paid out 2:1, unless he has a total of 21, in which case he receives 3:1. If the dealer holds a 5-Dragon without busting, all players must double their initial bet and pay him. If the dealer holds five cards with a total of 21, players triple their initial bet and pay him.\r\nEverything else in Chinese Blackjack is played the same as a standard version of the game.\r\n\r\nDifference Between Chinese Blackjack and Traditional Blackjack\r\nObviously, the main difference between the two versions of Blackjack are the winning combinations included in the Chinese version. It’s important to note that the value of the Ace changes depending upon how many cards the player holds in Chinese Blackjack. If they hold two cards, an Ace is counted as 10 or 11. If they hold three cards, Aces can be counted as 1 or 10. With four or more cards, an Ace will only count as 1.\r\n\r\nHowever, one further difference states that if the dealer holds a total of 16-20 from his initially dealt cards, he may reveal a certain number of player hands before deciding if he should hit or stand. If the dealer busts, all players are paid even money on their hands. If the dealer reaches a total of 21 without busting, the dealer wins.\r\n\r\nKey feature: \r\n\r\n* Gorgeous HD graphics and slick, fast gameplay\r\n* Realistic sounds, and smooth animations\r\n* Fast and clean interface.\r\n* Offline playable: you dont need an internet connection to play this game, it run perfectly fine when offline\r\n* Constant playing: you don't need to wait for other player to play this game\r\n* Completely free: you don't need any money to play this game, the chips in the game are also free to get.\r\n\r\nDownload Chinese Blackjack - Ban Luck now for free!\r\n\r\nBlue Wind casino\r\nBring the casino to your home",

  "description": "This game is base on the famous game blackjack 21 game now you don't have to go to the casino to play, now you can play on the go with the blackjack 21 mobile app.\r\n\r\nThe basic premise of the game is that you want to have a hand value that is closer to 21 than that of the dealer, without going over 21.\r\nValues of the Cards -\r\n* An Ace can count as either 1 or 11.\r\n* The cards from 2 through 9 are valued at their face value.\r\n* The 10, Jack, Queen, and King are all valued at 10.\r\nThe value of a hand is simply the sum of the point counts of each card in the hand. For example, a hand containing (5,7,8) has the value of 20.\r\nAce will be counted as 1 only if you are going over 21 or there are two Aces in the hand.\r\nFor example, a hand containing (A,7) has the value of 18. A hand containing (A,7,8) has the value of 16. Here Ace is counted as 1.\r\nYou have two options -\r\nHit - Means you want to draw another card.\r\nStand - Means you stop at the current total.",
