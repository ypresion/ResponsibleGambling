Here is what you should know\r\n\r\nSpread betting deals with legal staking, where profits and losses are calculated according to the level at which the value of a particular asset changes from the spread quoted by the trading platform. In spread trading, participants do not actually own the underlying asset they trade on, such as a stock or commodity.\r\n\r\nThe “spread” is a term used to refer to two prices— the bid price and the offer price. These two prices are always woven around the basic market price.\r\n\r\nThe spread broker advertises their bid and offer prices.  You, as the trader, can choose to invest on either price.  The outcome is decided according to the initial price being higher/lower than what you chose to invest on.\r\n\r\nSpread betting allows you to trade on the price movements or variations on a great number of financial markets, with indices, shares, stock, commodities, and currencies.\r\n\r\nTry the app today and get:\r\n\r\n\tAn award-winning platform and modern technology \r\n\tSwift, easy payments and highly secure withdrawals\r\n\tExceptional trade execution, risk management and honest pricing\r\n\tOver twenty years of experience in spread betting, CFD, and forex trades\r\n\tAn experienced relationship management for insight and trading supports\r\n\r\n\r\nSome of the things our app allows users to do include:\r\n\r\n\tReviewing trade and order history \r\n\tLive pricing of data to monitor chart prices\r\n\tChecking recent prices and market variations\r\n\tTightening spreads from 0.5 points on forex pairs\r\n\tMonitoring statements, balances and edit account information\r\n\tMonitoring and correcting multiple watch lists on favourite markets\r\n\tAccessing the latest market news and information from Thomson Reuters\r\n\tResearching prices using real-time charts and multiple technical indicators\r\n\tTrading and amending existing orders and place guaranteed stop loss orders\r\n\tQuick opening and closing of positions with faster and simpler trading tickets\r\n\r\nGetting Started\r\n\r\nInstall the app, register an account and fund your account to start trading!\r\n\r\nEvery account gets a FREE demo account to practice spread betting, CFD trading, and forex trading.\r\n\r\nDownload now and start trading today!",

  "description": "Betc was created by a team of crypto enthusiasts who greatly believe in the fundamental principles behind blockchain technology.  \r\n\r\nFounders of Betc were determined to find a solution to one of the heavy risks involved with bitcoin exchange - the high volatility of the asset. For example, it is not uncommon for Bitcoin price to drop by 5% only to recover in a few moments. This can be a problem for traders – but it can be a great source of entertainment for gamers who want to be part of the Bitcoin action without the heaviness involved in investments and trading.  Henceforth, the first spread-betting with no commission site was developed, with the user experience at the forefront.\r\n\r\nThe vision behind Betc was to provide a fun and simple platform where the people can enjoy fast gratification from the wild-swinging Bitcoin market, safely.   \r\n\r\nIntegrity:\r\nWe call it as it is.  It’s a bet.  And there’s never a dull moment!",

To this end, nextmarkets has developed a very easy to use Trading Platform for private investors which covers over 1000 instruments via intuitively driven web and mobile apps. These include CFDs on stock, currency (Forex, FX), bond and commodity markets. \r\n\r\nIt is scientifically proven that more than 80 percent of all private investors fail in the capital markets. This has mainly behavioral finance reasons. Human behaviour is sometimes affected by fear, greed and arrogance and this often leads to irrational decisions when dealing with money at the exchange. \r\n\r\nTherefore nextmarkets wanted to develop a platform in which customers are not left out on their own, but their Trading Coaches will train and support users in their everyday trading. With Curated Investing, we will help you to understand the capital markets. nextmarkets customers can choose from more than a dozen coaches. Each of these coaches is a professional in a determined area (for example Stock Trading and Technical Analysis techniques).\r\n\r\nThe best part: Experts communicate with clients via analyses and transactions directly on the customer's chart. Experience every step of your experts live in the chart. The user most often sees the approach based on chart analysis and which indicators the coach uses. In addition, the expert's comments appear in a kind of \"chat monologue\", so that subscribers may understand why the coach makes decisions and how the coach analyzes the markets. The customers receive interesting trading ideas and  they also learn about the cause and effect principles and learn how to better analyse the markets. After a few weeks they understand  what is moving the markets and how markets may be mastered. Simply learning by doing.\r\n\r\nFinally, users can easily follow the trading ideas of users at a fingertip. Whenever a transaction appears out the trading idea, the user follows that trade with a previously determined quantity. \r\n\r\nnextmarkets offers their users a demo account with virtual 10,000 Euros. And finally, you can trade real money and open your account within minutes.",

  "description": "Guide For Learn Forex Trading - Learn to Trade. Complete Master Guide For Learn Forex Trading - Learn to Trade 2020 - No Ads\r\n\r\nLearn everything you need to know to start Trading on the Forex Market today!\r\n\r\nIn this course I will show you how you can take advantage of currency movements to make profits. We will talk in detail about Currencies, Charts, Bulls & Bears, Short Selling, \r\n\r\nlearn how to read the Calendar of Economic events, which is imperative for Fundamental trading on Forex as well as other Financial marketplaces such as NYSE, London Stock Exchange, Futures Exchanges, and more.\r\n\r\nI will thoroughly explain how Forex Brokers work, so that you are able to easily separate Honest Brokers from the unreliable ones when you are ready to open a Real Trading account. I even include a FREE guide to selecting a Forex broker, based on my own experience of Real trading.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI will also supply you with a Forex Market Hours wallpaper for YOUR timezone, allowing you to effortlessly monitor the activity of Global Forex Market participants throughout the day.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis course is for complete beginners! All you need is an open mind and a passion to be successful! \r\n\r\nWhat is Forex? \r\n\r\nForex, also known as foreign exchange,  FX, or currency trading, is a decentralized global market where all the world's currencies trade. The Forex market is the largest, most liquid market in the world with an average daily trading volume exceeding $5 trillion. All the world's combined stock markets don't even come close to this. But what does that mean to you? Take a closer look at Forex trading and you may find some exciting trading opportunities unavailable with other investments.\r\n\r\nWhy Learn Forex Trading: Advantages Of Forex Trading\r\n\r\nThere are many benefits and advantages of Forex Trading for Beginners. Here are just a few reasons why so many people are choosing Forex Trading:\r\n\r\nNo commissions Forex Trading\r\n\r\nNo clearing fees, no exchange fees, no government fees, no brokerage fees. Most retail brokers are compensated for their services through something called the “bid/ask spread“.\r\n\r\nNo middlemen in Forex Trading\r\n\r\nSpot currency trading eliminates the middlemen and allows you to trade directly with the market responsible for the pricing on a particular currency pair.\r\n\r\nNo fixed lot size in Forex Trading\r\n\r\nIn spot Forex, you determine your own lot or position size. This allows traders to participate with accounts as small as $25.\r\n\r\n\r\nForex Trading is a 24-hour market\r\n\r\nThere is no waiting for the opening bell. From the Monday morning opening in Australia to the afternoon close in New York, the forex market never sleeps. This is awesome for those who want to trade on a part-time basis because you can choose when you want to trade: morning, noon, night, during breakfast, or in your sleep.\r\n\r\nNo one can corner the market in Forex Trading\r\n\r\nThe foreign exchange market is so huge and has so many participants that no single entity can control the market price for an extended period of time.\r\n\r\nLow Barriers to Entry\r\n\r\nYou would think that getting started as a currency trader would cost a ton of money. The fact is, when compared to trading stocks, options, or futures, it doesn’t. Online forex brokers offer “mini” and “micro” trading accounts, some with a minimum account deposit of $25.\r\n\r\nTopics Included in this App\r\n\r\n1- Introduction to Forex Trading to Beginner\r\n2- The Structure of the Forex Market\r\n3- Major Currencies & Trade System\r\n4- Market Analysis in Forex Trading\r\n5- Type of Foreign Exchange Market\r\n6- Benefits of Forex Trading\r\n7- Fundamental Market Forces\r\n8- Technical Indicators in Forex Trading\r\n9- Pattern Study of Trends\r\n10- Technical Strategy in Price Patterns\r\n11- Oscillator Divergences\r\n12- The Role of Inflation in Forex Trading\r\n13- The Commodity Connection\r\n14- Position of Money Management\r\n15- Foreign Exchange Risks\r\n16- Trading Rules",

  "description": "Gatsby makes options trading simple by removing the commissions and the jargon.\r\nGatsby is a division of ViewTrade Securities, Inc., Members FINRA and SIPC. Gatsby Digital, Inc. is not a broker-dealer or investment advisor. Securities and investments are offered through ViewTrade Securities, Inc.\r\n\r\nOptions involve a high degree of risk and are not suitable for all investors as the special risks inherent to options trading may expose investors to potentially significant losses. Please read Characteristics and Risks of Standardized Options (https://www.theocc.com/components/docs/riskstoc.pdf) before deciding to invest in options.\r\n\r\nAll investments involve risk and past performance of a security does not guarantee future results or returns. While diversification may help spread risk, it does not guarantee a profit or protect you against loss in a down market. There is always a potential to lose money when investing in securities, and investors need to fully consider their investment objectives prior to investing. Gatsby does not support day trading.\r\n\r\nReferences to commission free trading refer to $0 commissions charged on self-directed individual cash brokerage accounts that trade U.S. listed securities. SEC & FINRA fees may apply. Please refer to our fee schedule for a complete listing of relevant charges.  \r\nSystem response, trade executions and account access may be affected by market conditions, system performance, quote delays and other factors. The risk of loss in electronic trading can be substantial. You should therefore consider whether such trading is suitable for you in light of your financial resources and circumstances.\r\n\r\nThis is not an offer or solicitation in any jurisdiction where we are not authorized to do business.

The performance of ETFs can vary from the investment result of the targeted underlying indices. Expenses and fees can also impact the performance of ETFs and cause a divergence from the underlying index or ETF investment strategy. ETFs bare risks similar to those of other diversified portfolios. Inverse ETFs and Leveraged ETFs may not be suitable for all investors and may increase exposure to volatility through the short sale of securities, use of leverage, use of derivatives and other complex investment strategies. The ETF prospectus should be read carefully and contains additional critical information about the ETF. Customers should obtain prospectuses from the issuer and/or their third party agent. ETFs are required to distribute portfolio gains to shareholders at year end, which may be generated by portfolio rebalancing or the need to meet diversification requirements. ETF trading generates tax consequences for the ETF holder. Additional regulatory guidance on Exchange Traded Products can be found by clicking here (https://www.sec.gov/investor/alerts/etfs.pdf).",

Or would you rather learn specific correlations that have been used and proven by traders? A few examples:\r\n \r\n▶ When the price of gold rises, so does AUD against USD.\r\n▶ If the oil prices go down, so does CAD against JPY.\r\n▶ If the weather forecast predicts high temperatures in Russia, then the wheat price goes up.\r\n  \r\nFollow our social accounts to stay updated with the latest tips and improvement news:\r\n\r\n▶ Facebook: www.facebook.com/pg/Forex-Hero-1534786416537763\r\n▶ Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/forexheroapp/ \r\n▶ Website: https://forexhero.eu \r\n \r\nWe’d love to hear from you.
