Its awful. Feed constantly freezes or doesn't work at all and app prone to freezing completely. If you have ATR/RUK on TV to watch then fine, but if you want to stream look elsewhere.",

If they increase, surprise surprise, you already made bet doesn't change. Is this even legal? Doesn't update fast enough and the score often incorrectly changes, which delays the new odds even more. If overwatch games go beyond map 3, you likely won't be able to bet on further maps as, by the time it registers that there's a 4th/5th map, the match has started.",
