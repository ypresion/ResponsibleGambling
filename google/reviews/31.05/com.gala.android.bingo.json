Always same winner and when you say anything in the chat on bingo you have what I assume is a moderator telling you it's a game of luck and to not put such things about it being the same winners or I'll have to leave the game!+ they was the constant winner. Lol wasn't the only one to notice this as a few said it too.",

I love bingo but its better to just go to one rather than play a game you dont have a chance of winning online.",
