Love this app...\"\n\n5 stars: \"Great app - Finally a Poker app that helps me improve my game against my poker buddies\"\n\nOn Twitter: \n\n\"@InstaPoker - I really loving this app. It breaks scenarios down in a very detailed and playable manner. Great job guys\"\n\nPlay challenging hands and receive instant feedback from the pros, including poker’s all-time leading money winner, Antonio Esfandiari, and WSOP Main Event winner and owner of 4 WSOP bracelets, Huckleberry Seed.\n\n\nWin and score by making quality decisions, not by winning chips.\n \nFeatures:\n* Poker hands are packaged into Hand-Packs™, covering various aspects of Hold'em from low-stakes home games to major tournament events.\n\n* Win in-app currency, called ProCoins, based on the merit of your play, not the outcome of the hand. Use ProCoins to unlock Bonus Hand-Packs.\n\n* Game scenarios crafted by world-class poker pros and based on actual hands played in WSOP and WPT tournaments and cash games.\n\n* Contributing pros include Antonio Esfandiari, Huck Seed, Daniel O’Brien, Jonathan Little, Amir Lehavot,  Matt Berkey and Konstantin Othmer.\n\n* Each move is followed by detailed explanations that open your eyes to the way top pros think and play.\n\n* Play for FREE an entire Hand-Pack! You can also PREVIEW a hand from each Premium Hand-Pack,  over 24 free hands.\n\n* No account creation, no network connection to play. Download the hand-packs and play anywhere to improve your poker skills and to see if you can play like a pro.\n \n****************************\n“I thought I was a decent hold ‘em player – until pros Antonio Esfandiari and Huck Seed told me otherwise.”\n- Michael Shapiro, San Francisco Chronicle\n****************************\n \nGameplay basics:\nMake the “Best Move,” and you are awarded +3 ProCoins. Make a “Good Move” or “Fair Move” and you’ll earn +2 or +1 ProCoins, respectively. Make a “Bad Move,” and well, zero points for you, but you will earn the advice of the pro, who will explain why it was the wrong decision and his thought process behind making the right one.\n\nThe goal of each Hand-Pack is to score a perfect +3 ProCoins on every move of every hand. Do so, and you’ll be fast on your way to mastering No-Limit Hold ‘em and outplaying your opponents at the poker table, whether in your home game or the World Series in Las Vegas.",

  "description": "Poker time? EasyPoker lets you play social multiplayer poker with your friends - anytime, anywhere. Designed for the true live poker experience.\n \nNo deck of cards? No poker chips? No problem.\n\n\nAll you need are your phones! \n\n\n1) Easily create a game\n2) Tell your friends the game code\n3) Play poker - free of charge \n\nSometimes you just wanna play some poker with your friends. \nBut what if you don't have a deck of playing cards or chips with you? Maybe you're out camping, at your neighbour's cat's birthday party or on a train ride to a certain school of witchcraft and wizardry? \n\nOur app brings together the best of digital poker and traditional live face to face poker. Now you can play F2F poker with your friends, without having to bring a poker set with you at all times. Imagine playing a game of multiplayer poker around the campfire, at the beach, the bar, the park, in the train, while waiting for food in the restaurant, when skydiving - Really, it’s only limited by your imagination. You and your friends just need the free EasyPoker app on your phone and we’ll take care of the rest.\n\nWhy choose between the social experience of real life live poker and the convenience of digital hold’em poker? We’ve combined the two! \n\n- Multiplayer Texas Hold’em Poker\n- Designed for live F2F poker\n- No wifi or bluetooth needed\n- Cross platform capability\n- Connect instantly with a game code\n- Provides both cards and chips\n- Free to play\n- Intuitive design\n- No credit card registration \n\nA DIFFERENT POKER APP\n\nEasyPoker is not your classic texas hold’em app. We are not a betting platform or an online casino. We don’t facilitate the betting of real money. In fact we don’t use play money or chips of any kind. Just create a game and you are ready.\nInstead, we think of EasyPoker as “just” a digital poker set - one that fits right into your pocket. EasyPoker is designed to simulate the experience of live poker. This means that you don’t have to compromise - even if you don’t have a physical poker set with you. \n\nEasyPoker’s mission is not to replace the physical poker set - if you have a deck of playing cards and poker chips at your disposal, then by all means, use them. We would. \nInstead our purpose is to facilitate the same social experience of face to face poker, when you’re not around your classic poker set. We also eliminate the need for a physical table, which is handy if you’re playing around, say, a campfire. \n\nEasyPoker is meant to be played live, and in the presence of good friends. \nAt its core, poker has always been a social experience, and we think it is best played face to face. Reading your opponents face is a big part of the classic game and we think this part is often lost with traditional online poker. After all, it’s called a “poker face”, and not a “poker avatar”. \n\nLET'S DO THIS TOGEHER\n\nEasyPoker is a relative small but fast moving team. We’re constantly testing and trying to improve our app and the experience of digital face to face poker. \nTherefore we’d love to hear any suggestions and wishes you might have. \nYou’ll find a neat suggestion box on our website https://easy.poker/. \n\nEASYPOKER+\n\nWith a Plus+ subscription you can play up to 12 people at a table, edit stacks, blinds, increasing blinds and accept rebuys.\n\nPlease notice that EasyPoker does not include any kind of real money gambling features.\n\n__________________________________________\n\nIf you choose to purchase EasyPoker Premium, payment will be charged to your iTunes account, and your account will be charged for renewal within 24-hours prior to the end of the current period. Auto-renewal may be turned off at any time by going to your settings in the iTunes Store after purchase. Current EasyPoker+ subscription price starts at $5.99 USD/month, and one-month, 6-month and 12-month packages are available.\n\nTerms of use: https://easy.poker/terms-conditions/",

Includes bonus bets.\n\n5) Red Dog Poker - The game only uses three cards at a time, which are ranked as in poker. Suit is irrelevant. A wager is placed, and two cards are placed face up on the table, with three possible outcomes: \n  1) If the cards are consecutive in number, the hand is a push and the player's wager is returned.\n  2) If the two cards are of equal value, a third card is dealt. If the third card is of the same value, then the payout for the player is 11:1, otherwise the hand is a push.\n  3) If neither of the above is the case, then a spread is announced which determines the payoff, and a third card will be dealt.\n\n6) Asian Stud - The goal is to score the most points. Aces and the one joker are worth 1 and each card is worth their numerical value with tens and face cards worth 10. The dealer deals 5 cards to each player. The players may then evalulate their hand and choose to raise or fold. The player then splits the cards into a 3-card-hand and 2-card-hand. The 3-card-hand must total 10, 20 or 30 points to qualify otherwise the 2-card-hand is irrelevant. If the 3-card-hand does not qualify the only way for the player to win is if the dealer also does not qualify in which case any player who did not fold wins. If the 3-card-hand qualifies for both the player and the dealer then the points in the 2-card-hand is calculated\n\n7) Keno - select from 2 - 12 numbers out of 80 available numbers to select from. \n\n8) Video Poker - 6 variants of the casino favorite. \n  - Jacks or Better\n  - Tens or Better\n  - Bonus Poker\n  - Double Bonus Poker\n  - Deuces Wild\n  - Joker Wild\n\n9) Casino WAR - your favourite childhood card game is a legit casino card game.
