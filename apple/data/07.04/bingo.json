  "description": "The \"Bingo at Home\" app is a bingo caller to play bingo at home, among family or friends.\n\nWhen a bingo game starts, the app begins to call the bingo balls. The game can be paused and restarted as needed, for example, to check if the line or bingo is correct, to check all the numbers already called, etc.\n\nThere are two game modes:\n\n- Automatic mode: The app begins to call the bingo balls until paused or until there are no more balls left. The app allows to configure the speed with which the balls are called.\n\n- Manual mode: The calling of the balls is made by tapping a button. Each time you tap the button, the app calls the next ball. If it is desired, you can silence the app so that the same person who is in charge of calling the balls is the one who announces the numbers.\n\nThe app can be used to play 90 balls bingo, the bingo variant that is played in Spain, and to play 75 balls bingo, the american bingo variant.\n\nIn the 90 balls bingo variant, the first one that completes a line is awarded with the line prize, and the first one that completes the whole bingo card is awarded with the bingo prize.\n\nIn the 75 balls bingo variant there is only one prize, the winner is the first who completes the shape currently in play in the bingo card. The app has several shapes to choose that you can complete. Every new game the shape changes, you can either start the game with this shape or select a new one.\n\nThe bingo cards to play at home can be printed for free from the Bingo.es website:\n\nhttp://www.bingo.es/cartones-bingo/ \n\nOr you can download our companion app \"Bingo Cards\" from:\n\nhttps://itunes.apple.com/es/app/cartones-de-bingo/id954591326",

Each player profile consists of a unique name (up to 20 characters) and a fun cartoon avatar. The player profiles display total number of games played, total number of high scores achieved, and total number of Bingo Bugs collected. The guest profile does not store any information and therefore cannot achieve high scores or collect Bingo Bugs.

Players will be prompted to select a game type before game play. Selecting a Level There are three levels of game play in Math Bingo: easy, medium, and hard. Players will be prompted to select a game level before game play. Score Board Math Bingo displays high scores in the Score Board. There are four different Score Boards: addition, subtraction, multiplication and division. Each Score Board displays the top three scores for each level: easy, medium, and hard. \n\nBingo Bugs \nBingo Bugs are rewards for achieving a high score. A player who earns a high score will collect a Bingo Bug! Players can collect a variety of Bingo Bugs and interact with them by tapping the Bingo Bug button in the player profile or by tapping the My Bingo Bugs button after playing a game. HINT: Tilt your device to make the Bingo Bugs move around, tap on a Bingo Bug to make them giggle and spring! \n\nSettings\nThe settings menu can be accessed by clicking the information button on the lower right hand side the introduction screen.

  "description": "Bingo Machine replaces the traditional bingo number caller with a simple, all-in-one, iPhone and iPad application. Call American 75-ball and English 90-ball bingo games. \n\nWith a bingo card in hand, Bingo Machine handles everything else — no need for a traditional bingo caller tumbler or expensive electronic equipment.\n\nAs each ball is selected, Bingo Machine keeps a running history of balls so you can see all the called numbers as the game progresses.\n\nThe app includes human and synthesized speech voices. Bingo Machine can read out each ball with recorded human male and female voices, or a high-quality synthetic voice for your language. Even if Bingo Machine is muted, it shows you bingo catchphrases on the screen so you know what to say as the announcer for each bingo number.\n\nUse the Timer feature to call balls automatically, on a repeating interval. Set a time interval and Bingo Machine calls balls until the game is over.\n\nBingo Machine adapts to the game type. For English-style games, call up to 90 balls. For American games, call up to 75 balls with each ball accompanied by its corresponding B-I-N-G-O symbol.\n\nFor group settings, connect Bingo Machine to an external display or projector to show the game on the big screen. This is perfect for charity events, schools and other large room events. You can connect using a compatible TV-Out cable for your iPhone or iPad, or connect wirelessly to an Apple TV using AirPlay Screen Mirroring.\n\nBingo Machine can also be used as a teaching tool for learning numbers in foreign languages. Switch between English, Chinese, French, German and Spanish language options. The synthesized voice can even speak each language so you can hear how the number is meant to be pronounced.\n\nBingo Machine features rich design and finesse. The app is optimized for both the iPhone in your hand, and the larger canvas of the iPad display. It includes a beautiful theme for the new iOS 13 Dark Mode appearance, and is proud to support vision-impaired accessibility needs with comprehensive VoiceOver support.\n\nBingo caller software is typically clunky and complex. Bingo Machine is the opposite. Feature packed and simple to use.",

Play with 5x5 bingo cards.\n90 balls: Standard Housie. Play with 3x9 housie cards.\n\nOnce you set the bingo type, you just have to roll the 3D bingo machine. \nMore fun way to play with iPhone/iPod Touch is, pass \"BINGO!\" to each of the members and let everyone have chance to roll it!\n\nIf anyone claims bingo, tap Master Board to check the numbers. For the accuracy and convenience, this record remains until the game ends. \nEven if one of your friend accidentally quits the app, don't worry. The record still remains.\n\nWhat about the bingo card?\n\"BINGO!\" does not have bingo card feature, because it's difficult to ask everyone to have iPhone/iPod Touch for bingo card app. So here's our suggestion:\n\n1. Buy bingo cards at party store.\n\n2. Download FREE bingo cards from our website.\nhttp://www.valup.co.jp/iphone/Bingo/index-en.html\n\n3. Make your own bingo card by hand.\nFor bingo 25: Draw 3x3 squares and randomly fill the numbers 1-25.\nFor bingo 75: Draw 5x5 squares, fill the numbers 1-75. Leave center for FREE.\n\nIf you have time, you can even prepare some prizes to make it more exciting.\nGood luck and have fun!",

The list is comprised of 220 words grouped by level, and includes pronouns, adjectives, adverbs, prepositions, conjunctions and verbs.  There are also 95 nouns on a separate list.\n\nSight Word BINGO includes four different games!\n\nWord BINGO \n\nListen to the word the BINGO Bug speaks and tap on the corresponding word on the screen.  Get four words correct vertically, horizontally or diagonally to get BINGO and win!  The quicker you get BINGO the better your score.  Your score is based on time and the lower the score, the better.  Earn a BINGO Bug when you beat your best score.\n\nSpelling Practice\n \nTap and drag the letters to spell the word the BINGO bug speaks.  Spell ten words to play a bonus game!  You can choose to show or hide the spelling of each word in game settings.\n\nWord Fling \n\nYou have one hundred seconds to find as many BINGO Bugs as possible and fling them into the warp zone!  To find the bug, tap the word the BINGO bug speaks.  If you tap the correct word, a BINGO Bug and a bungee cord will appear.  Pull downward and left or right to aim the BINGO Bug toward the warp zone hole.  Let go to fling the BINGO Bug! Bounce the bug off of the wall before going into the warp zone for more points. The game will end once you incorrectly recognize three words.\n\nWord It Up \n\nStop the word blocks from stacking up to the top of the screen!  Tap on the word the BINGO bug speaks to get rid of the block.  Tilt the device to change where the block lands.  Try not to click on the wrong word or you’ll lose points and the block will stay forever.\n\n---------------------\n\nWord BINGO features:\n\nUniversal App - Only $.99 for iPad, iPod & iPhone\n\n4 Games in 1: Word BINGO  |  Spelling Practice  |  Word It Up  |  Fling it\n\n5 player profiles & guest profile\n\nCreate your own character\n\nOver 300 Dolch Sight Words\n\nSelect a word list: Pre-Primer, Primer, First Grade, Second Grade, Third Grade, Nouns or All Words\n\nScore Board: the three best scores are displayed by word list and player displays top three best scores by word list and by player.\n\nEasily track and view what words that you got wrong by using the “My Report” Card feature.\n\nMy Report Card: A powerful feature that displays word accuracy and best scores by player profile.

It has all the fun of the traditional Bingo game, with the additional motivation of earning ice-cream ingredients with which to create unique ice-creams in Ruby's ice-cream parlour! \n\nThe Squeebles games have been featured on BBC Radio, in The Daily Telegraph, The Observer, The Guardian and on numerous app review and educational sites. The apps make learning fun an child-safe environment that's completely free of in-app purchases, links to the internet or third party advertising.  \n\nFeaturing the infamous Maths Monster, this time he's frightened all Ruby's customers away from her ice cream and bingo parlour and has stolen all the ice cream ingredients.\n\nBy answering addition, subtraction, multiplication and division problems in a fun bingo card game, help Ruby get her ingredients back and convince the 24 Squeeble customers to return.\n\nMake ice creams from over 200 unique ingredients and feed them to the Squeebles, who will give you marks out of ten, depending on how much they like them. Remember though - some of the Squeebles like some very strange flavours!!! Try brussel sprout ice cream with butterscotch sauce, sugar mice and a garlic breadstick! Or how about orange ice cream with pea soup sauce, chocolate pebbles and a lollipop! With over 3 million combinations, there's something in there for everyone (and every Squeeble!!!)\n\nUnlimited player profiles can be registered, making this app ideal for classroom use as well as for using at home.\n\nStats are available for each player so parents and teachers can see how they're doing and as usual with our apps, there are absolutely no in-app purchases, adverts of any kind or web links. Your children will be 100% safe using this app.\n\nHave fun whilst learning with the Squeebles!\n\nIf you have any questions, then please e-mail the KeyStageFun team on info@keystagefun.co.uk",
