It has an easy-to-use strategy guide that shows the correct move for every combination of hands. \n\nBlackjack 101 allows you to adjust the playing rules to match conditions commonly found in casinos, including the number of decks in the shoe, the dealer's action on a soft 17, doubling rules, and surrender. It also allows you to focus your training on the trickier hands: pairs and soft hands. Plus it has both a left- and right-handed layout, to make it easy to play with one hand or two. \n\nIntroducing a new feature: Custom Hands training mode. in this mode you can choose any combination of player hands and dealer up-cards to practice. Only want to practice soft hands against a dealer's 6? No problem. Or practice soft 14s-16s vs. any dealer card? Easy. Or get fancy and practice a hard 15 or 16, soft 13 or a pair of 4's vs. any dealer card over 5. Any combo you can imagine. \n\nFeatures: \n\n- Four learning modes: random hands, soft hands, pairs, and a new Custom mode: choose any combination of hands to practice.\n\n- Skill levels: Higher levels concentrate your training on the harder-to-memorize hands \n\n- Strategy guide shows all the best moves and highlights the strategy for the current hand and dealer card\n\n- Left-handed and right-handed playing layouts \n\n- Many different rule configurations (1-4 decks, dealer hits/stays on soft 17, double after split, early/late surrender) \n\n- Keeps track of your stats: hands played, choices made, and percent of correct guesses",

  "description": "BlackJack, also known as Twenty-one or Vingt-et-un (French: \"twenty-one\"), is the most widely played casino banking game in the world. BlackJack is a comparing card game between a player and dealer and played with one or more French decks of 52 cards. The player is dealt an initial two card hand with the option of drawing cards to bring the total value to 21 or less without exceeding it, so that the dealer will lose by having a lesser hand than the player or by exceeding 21. Since the 1960s, BlackJack has been a high profile target of advantage players, particularly card counters, who track the profile of cards yet to be dealt, and adapt their wager and playing strategy accordingly. While in our implementation we do not teach counting, we do offer basic strategy hints to train you on how to improve your odds. Many rule variations of BlackJack exist. Our implementation offers most common casino rules:\n- Play with 4 decks\n- Decks are reshuffled when there is less than 20 cards left.\n- Dealer stands on soft 17\n- Player can split twice\n- Neither surrender nor insurance are offered\n- When hints are enabled, player would need to confirm his choice if it's not the most optimum action.\n\nWhen you running short on credits, feel free to use our build in slot machine - truly the loosest slots in town!\n\nDon't forget to check our Game section for other fun games...",

  "description": "Blackjack Apprenticeship's \"Card Counting Trainer Pro\" is the best way to master card counting so you can bring down the house! Blackjack Apprenticeship trains card counters who have legally beaten casinos for millions with the same skills learned in this app!\n\n******** Featured in: New York Times, CNN, ABC World News, Good Morning America, The Colbert Report, Huffington Post ********\n\nIntroducing the Blackjack trainer created and developed by Professional Blackjack players. Blackjackapprenticeship.com is the authority on teaching you how to play Blackjack like the pros. With over a decade of combined experience and millions of dollars won, the Pros here can help you take your game from amateur gambler, to winning professional.\n\nPerhaps you just watched the movie “21”, or you’ve read “Bringing Down the House”, you are ready to take your Blackjack game to the next level. This is where Blackjack Trainer Pro comes in to help you up your game - without being an MIT student.\n\nBlackjack Trainer Pro works hand in hand with Blackjackapprenticeship.com. We teach you step-by-step instruction on how to get the advantage over the house.\n\nWe don’t give you multiple counting methods here because you only need one: HiLo. We help you hone one counting system and use it to its fullest potential. Be an expert, not a “Jack of all systems.” That is the difference between a gambler and a winner.\n\nBlackjack Trainer Pro helps you keep the Running count, shows you the True Count and guides you if you make a Basic Strategy or Deviation mistake. We want you to be on top of your game when you go into the casino. Practice at home, then run through a few shoes in your hotel room before hitting the tables to freshen up.\n\n******** FEATURES ********\n\n* Basic Strategy – Build your blackjack foundation\n* Learn HiLo – the most efficient yet powerful card counting system known today\n* Learn how to keep the Running count, convert to a true count and use that information to your advantage over the house.\n* Strategy Deviations – We provide you with the charts you need to be successful\n* Real Hand Signals – Use the same hand signals as you would in the casino: Hit, Stand, Double Down, Spit, and Surrender!\n* Customize your game: Dealer Hits or Stands on soft 17, Resplit Aces, Double after Split, and Surrender are all rule options.\n\n***** TESTIMONIES *****\n\n“This app is easily worth the $$$, I just got back from Atlantic City and won enough to pay for my whole trip!” - JC\n\n“I’ve been training with blackjackapprenticeship for 3 months now and am stoked to have their training go with me everywhere. I’ve used this app right before walking into the casino even.” - LB\n\n“This app is just what I was looking for! Not a silly blackjack game, but an actual Trainer!”\n\n\"This app combined with the videos on the website has improved my blackjack game 300%!\"",

This Solitaire is the familiar Windows™ FreeCell game you used to play on your computer.\n\nIt requires a lot of patience and skill to win! After dealing the deck of 52 cards, use the four free cell s as placeholders as you try and move all the other cards to the Foundation stacks to win. Be careful! You can't move more than one card as there is no free cell or column. This is the tricky thing about FreeCell. You have to decide when to place a card on a free cell and when it is necessary to leave a column completely free. \n\nThis FreeCell gives you the classic Windows™ version combined with stunning graphics and animations! You also have more individual settings like different card decks or background images to choose from.\nYou can do a lot more things than in other Solitaire Apps in the Apple Store. Two very rare features are the “easy mode” and the added difficulties. If someone needs a greater or lesser challenge with FreeCell they can decide between 4, 2, or one free cell. \n\nHave this great experience all over the world any time you want on your Apple Device!\n\n== Features ==\n\n• Simple and intuitive interface\n• Unlimited undos\n• Classic FreeCell with 4, 2, or just one free cell.\n• Easy Mode for a faster game experience\n• Auto hint\n• Statistics\n• Hints for a faster win\n• Individual Images for card decks and game background\n• “Tap to move” control for simple gameplay\n• Portrait and Landscape View\n• A lot of cool settings\n• Daily challenges\n\nPlay the popular CLASSIC FreeCell Solitaire card game on iOS for FREE now!",

A wager is placed, and two cards are placed face up on the table, with three possible outcomes: \n  1) If the cards are consecutive in number, the hand is a push and the player's wager is returned.\n  2) If the two cards are of equal value, a third card is dealt. If the third card is of the same value, then the payout for the player is 11:1, otherwise the hand is a push.\n  3) If neither of the above is the case, then a spread is announced which determines the payoff, and a third card will be dealt.\n\n6) Asian Stud - The goal is to score the most points. Aces and the one joker are worth 1 and each card is worth their numerical value with tens and face cards worth 10. The dealer deals 5 cards to each player. The players may then evalulate their hand and choose to raise or fold. The player then splits the cards into a 3-card-hand and 2-card-hand. The 3-card-hand must total 10, 20 or 30 points to qualify otherwise the 2-card-hand is irrelevant. If the 3-card-hand does not qualify the only way for the player to win is if the dealer also does not qualify in which case any player who did not fold wins. If the 3-card-hand qualifies for both the player and the dealer then the points in the 2-card-hand is calculated\n\n7) Keno - select from 2 - 12 numbers out of 80 available numbers to select from. \n\n8) Video Poker - 6 variants of the casino favorite. \n  - Jacks or Better\n  - Tens or Better\n  - Bonus Poker\n  - Double Bonus Poker\n  - Deuces Wild\n  - Joker Wild\n\n9) Casino WAR - your favourite childhood card game is a legit casino card game.  Bonus tie wagers available with 10x payout.\n\nPlease let us know if there is a game you would like added.\n\n\n\nReceive FREE coins daily!",
