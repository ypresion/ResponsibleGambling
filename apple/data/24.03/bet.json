  "description": "Win up to $10,000 by making a \"bet\" on your own weight loss, or by participating in one of our many weight loss and fitness challenges. There’s a reason we paid out millions to our participants last year - our challenges are fun, effective, and people love to win money for losing weight!\n\nAccording to one of our participants, “HealthyWage has flipped on a switch that I just couldn’t seem to get clicked on by myself. Not sure, or what science is behind it, but this...is astounding!”\n\nWe flip on that switch for participants looking to get healthier over and over again. In fact, 78% of our participants report weight loss¹ when participating in a HealthyWage Challenge, with an average prize payout of $1,239². Oh, and we DO know the science behind it. We’re kind of nerdy like that!\n\nCheck out some of the features you’ll enjoy with the HealthyWage app:\n\n- Take and post-victory and before-and-after photos\n- Participate with a vibrant community for support and accountability\n- Keep track of your weight loss and your progress toward hitting your goal (and winning money!)\n- Track your step activity throughout the day\n- Create and submit your beginning and ending weigh-in verification videos\n- Access your winnings to cash out or begin another challenge\n- Keep an eye on your standing among other players\n- Build friendships, get inspired by others success, and practice your best cheerleading skills\n- Easily find and enter new challenges\n\nThere are 4 different types of HealthyWage Challenges you can join through the app. Those are:\n\nThe HealthyWager\nWin up to $10,000 in an individual weight loss bet.  Set the terms using the Prize Calculator (you choose your weight loss goal, wager amount, etc.).  Play with the calculator all you like without commitment.\n\n$10,000 Team Challenge\nTeams of five compete to win cash prizes -- first prize is $10,000.\n\nJackpot Challenges\nIndividuals and teams try to achieve specific weight loss goals to earn a share of the pot.\n\nStep Challenge\nIndividuals and teams connect step devices to calculate a custom goal. Achieve the step goal and earn a share of the pot! Devices available: Apple Health (Apple phones and watches via HealthKit), Garmin and Fitbit.\n\nHealthyWage's weight loss challenges have been featured on the Today show, Good Morning America, CNN, ABC News, NBC News, Fox News, and in The Wall Street Journal & The New York Times.\nFrom our participants:\n\n“HealthyWage is great for motivation. People have good intentions but lack the motivation. After having to stick with it for a period of time, that helps you change your habits for good and a healthy lifestyle becomes your new habit.”\n\n\"HealthyWage really exploited my competitive nature and used it to work for me!”\n\n“There's nothing better than losing weight, feeling great, getting healthy AND winning money at the same time!\"\n\n\"Putting up my own money definitely helped me win...the thought of the prize kept me focused. And, as weight started to come off, I was very excited about the process. It was not as hard as I thought it would be once I got my mind focused. I would definitely (and have) recommended this program to my friends! For people who are competitive, it will definitely motivate them to win!”\n\n“I would not have seen the results I got without HealthyWage. It offers something totally unique and takes away all the excuse.”\n\nOnce you experience the thrill of HealthyWage, you'll never go back to struggling on your own. Try it and see for yourself! Start a diet, bet on it, and win big! Losing weight and getting active with HealthyWage pays off in more ways than one!\n\n¹As reported by HealthyWage participants from January 2019 through January 2020. Stat will be updated at least annually.\n²The average prize amount varies seasonally.  The average listed here includes all new bets created from January 2019 through January 2020 and will be updated periodically.",

  "description": "The return of arcade pool from the creator of Really Bad Chess and Flipflop Solitaire.\n\nPocket-Run Pool combines 8-ball pool with the thrill of a chasing the perfect highscore.\n\nIn Pocket-Run, your goal is to sink all the balls, but where and when you sink them is what matters most! \n\nWith each pocketed ball, you're awarded points based on the pocket you sunk. So sink carefully, but watch out, with each miss or scratch you lose a life — run out before you finish the table and it's game over.\n\nCompete against yourself, the world, or the bank in a variety of thrilling game modes!\n\nCan you make the perfect pocket-run?\n\nArcade pool is back!\n\n------WHAT THE CRITICS ARE SAYING\n\n5/5 - Touch Arcade\n\"Help me, I can't stop playing!\"\n\n5/5 - 148Apps\n\"Most certainly the best pool game I've played on a phone\"\n\n\"Like the best arcade games, this creates a “just one more turn” mentality\" - The Verge\n\n\"a perfect little mobile game\" - iMore.com\n\n------WHATS IN THE “BOX”?\n\n- Play Pocket-Run Pool's Standard, High Stakes, and Insta-Tournament modes for free!\n- Asynchronously Go for gold against players from around the world in Insta-Tournament mode\n- Manage your risk against all manner of game conditions (like the devious Cuewall) in High Stakes mode\n- Unlock Break of The Week, alternate backgrounds, and remove Insta-Tournament buy-ins with a single In-App-Purchase of just $3.99\n- Track stats for all four modes\n- Win alternate pool cues and color schemes in High Stakes mode\n\n------A WORD FROM THE DEVELOPER\n\nI've always loved pool, and when I got my first iPhone years ago, the world of digital pool games opened up to me. \n\nThere are certainly a lot of options out there, but finding a simple and enjoyable single-player pool game was harder than I expected. I found one that I enjoyed, but after playing it extensively I found it too easy to beat the computer every time. Suddenly the problem with pool hit me — when you play against a computer in a physics simulation, you're literally playing against a god... By which I mean, either the computer is going easy on you (for a reason), or it's playing a perfect game and taking all your money.\n\nIt dawned on me that if I wanted a good single player pool game, I'd have to make a new kind of pool — a variant that doesn't need a computer opponent, that's built around the notion of scoring and improving, of taking risks, and of presenting unique and interesting challenges.\n\nPocket-Run Pool is the game I came up with, I hope you enjoy it!\n\n-zach",

  "description": "matched betting |mætʃt bɛtɪŋ|: noun. 1. a bеtting technique used by individuals to profit from the free bets and incentives offered by bookmakers. It is generally considered risk-free as it is based on the application of a mathematical equation rather than chance.\n\nMatched Betting Calculators is a suite of tools to help you make as much money from bookmaker offers as possible. You can access the Normal, Stake Not Returned and Stake Returned calculators straight away - these will give you the tools to calculate the lay stakes required to lay (essentially betting on the opposite outcome) your qualifying and free bets to ensure risk-free cash.\n\nOnce you understand the basics, Matched Betting Calculators goes beyond other apps to offer you an advanced suite of tools to calculate lay stakes for more complex offers.\n\nThe full app provides:\n\nNORMAL CALCULATOR\nCalculate lay stakes for qualifying and arbitrage bets.\n\nSTAKE NOT RETURNED CALCULATOR\nCalculate lay stakes for free bets (stake not returned).\n\nSTAKE RETURNED CALCULATOR\nCalculate lay stakes for free bets (stake returned).\n\nODDS MATCH BAR\nQuickly view the closeness between your back and lay odds with the Odds Match Bar (available in Normal, SNR, Risk Free and Early Payout calculators).\n\nTRIGGER CALCULATOR*\nCalculate lay stakes for the initial and trigger bets when a free bet is provided after a certain condition is met (e.g., money back on losing correct score bets when a certain team wins).\n\nRISK FREE CALCULATOR*\nGuarantee a profit when there's money back as a free bet if your initial bet loses.\n\nEXTRA PLACE CALCULATOR*\nIf a bookmaker is paying more places in a race than the exchange, calculate your profit should your horse finish in the extra place.\n\nLAY SEQUENTIAL CALCULATOR*\nLay enhanced multiples when legs don't overlap - keep laying until one leg loses. If either the final leg loses or all legs win, you are in profit, otherwise it is risk-free.\n\nODDS BOOST CALCULATOR*\nGuarantee profit when bookmakers are offering boosted odds with extra winnings over the original odds are paid as a free bet.\n\nEARLY PAYOUT CALCULATOR*\nIf the bookmaker settles your bet as a winner early, guarantee profit by backing the original outcome again. Use the Cash Out slider to trade out part of your bet, while leaving the rest in play with potential for larger profit!\n\n2-WAY & 3-WAY DUTCH CALCULATORS*\nInstead of laying a bet, you can choose to cover all outcomes with back bets. Use these calculators to equalise profits when there are two or three mutually exclusive outcomes.\n\nFRACTIONAL TO DECIMAL CONVERTER\nQuickly convert fractional odds to decimal and copy them to the clipboard. Also see the implied chance of the outcome happening from the odds.\n\nQUICK LINKS\nAccess popular exchanges and bookmakers quickly from the app.\n\nSIMPLE EV TOOL\nCalculate the expected value of a casino offer with wagering requirements.\n\nHISTORY\nView your logged bets to keep track of your profits over time.\n\nCUSTOMISE APP ICON\nOption for either a light or dark app icon.\n\n*requires Premium Mode, available as an in-app purchase from Settings.\n\nDownload Matched Betting Calculators today - whether you are a novice or an experienced matched bettor, there is no easier way to calculate your lay stakes and profit on your mobile device. \n\n- - -\n\nDISCLAIMER\nAlthough every effort has been taken to ensure the accuracy of these calculators, you use them at your own risk and the developers shall not be held liable for any loss, financial or otherwise, resulting from this application's use or misuse.
