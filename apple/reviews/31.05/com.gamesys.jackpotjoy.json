Playing Persian Fortunes was more like playing Russian Tortures.  10 seconds to show the cascade (not to mention the MISerable payouts).  Then I play another game.  And I notice that there are issues with the balance reducing more than the gameplay...( I think).  I didn't think much of  his as it was prhaps only ¬£1or so....but then, on the same game, I won around ¬£1.60 which didn't seem to transfer to my balance.  Then I noticed that again, for definite.  I go to try to live chat to ask someone to check for me...and the live chat box...won't open the keyboard on my device so I can't communicate with them. Now, I'm not techstupid! so I reopenth app, refresh, empty cache, uninstall and go in via the website (because trying the website route defaults to opning the app anyway).  Same thing on website, I can enter my details but can't chat back to the waiting agent.  I am now posting this as the only means of getting through and in the hope that JPJ will get their acts together."

Got free spins which added up to about 23p. Tried several different games which I had trouble accessing all(phone kept telling me to swipe up). The games are lacking everything,  quality, enthusiasm, graphics and value for money.  I then tried the free bingo after losing my money in under 10 minutes (I am not a newbie to gambling and I know the odds are against you but this site does seem rigged,  I play on Bet365 and no problems there)   I then tried to have a go at the free bingo but kept looping back to the homepage.  It was then I decided to delete my account.  The customer service was the best part of the app but I didn‚Äôt download the app to have a good customer service.  Feel like I would have had more excitement being mugged for my ¬£20. But no way to get my money back."

I then proceeded to win ¬£1.16 lol so played it all, I‚Äôm a maverick like that! The problem I have with this site is that like many others it says it‚Äôs into responsible gambling .. so why is the MINIMUM weekly deposit ¬£100, it should be ¬£10. They also have promotions which encourage you to spend more, at the moment one only lets you get the promotion if you spend ¬£5 a day for 3 consecutive days .. that‚Äôs is a BIG no I‚Äôm my book! We are all free to choose what we do with our money but when games are overly complicated to purchase tickets many being a min 25p bet with no clear guidance on how to change your stake,  it causes massive alarm bells for me. So I‚Äôll give this one a miss."
