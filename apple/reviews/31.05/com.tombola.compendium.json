  "text": "This game is actually well made if we are talking about graphic etc.. BUT guys do not think that you can win anything because that will never happen trust me they will let you win something like 20pounds after a couple of hundred bucks just to let you believe more in yourself:) I have been watching and playing to this game for days wasting time and money and what is really clear here it’s that this game is against any statistic even worse than an online casino. I saw winning the same bunch of accounts time by time day by day it doesn’t matter how many people are playing I saw winning the same accounts three four times in five six games in a row even when 3000 people where playing to the same game. Guys don’t say that no one told you then because with this review I definitely did! Just think the same accounts hit always the top prizes five six times in a row when the odds were 1 in 3000 in one game, 1 in 2800 in another, 1 in 2700 in another, 1 in 2000 in another and so on.. I have also tried to write it down into the chat but they don’t even let you post whatever you like of course :) This game should be free or completely removed from the apple store.. As far as I know by now there is still not places where you can play safely on the web.. unfortunately!!"

But as I’ve been bed bound and struggling to get out and about. And don’t want to be on the phone to friends all day as they’ve got other commitments and i don’t want to be taking up all of there free time. I always receive a warm welcome to any of the rooms. I enjoy speaking with everyone. No matter what time. I like being able to play the games in the chat rooms although they are small wins it isn’t all about the winning. It’s a community that anyone can join. It’s great fun. Always have someone to speak with and here about other people’s lives and there communities etc. I love it and so does my little girl. She’s 6 and loves to sit next to mum and watch and learn numbers so although I’m the one playing the game and it’s for people of age to gamble. But no harm showing the little one the numbers. I also recommend the app to all of my friends and would love to enjoy a meet up. Like i see on tv. :)"

Very little banter. I remember the good old days. Lol. All people do nowadays is count down. We are treated like children. Ok I don’t like swearing but surely if someone can mask a swear word to relieve the frustration of same names cropping up all the time that should be the adult thing to do. Anyway my limit is now £10 per week because I honestly can’t remember the last time I had a win in tombola. I’ve never thought it was fixed but now?....... well who knows and who can prove it?  Thanks for your generic response to my review. You did not respond to my comment of no banter or being treated like children. If someone asked if all the winners were genuine players I would have to reply that I don’t know but I would like to think they were. When the authorities come to calibrate your “random” machines how much notice do they give Tombola’s? When the auditors come to audit Tombola’s books how much notice do they give? Or because Tombola is registered overseas do these simple measures not apply in the name of fairness. I won’t even visit the question of paying British Tax."

  "text": "Been playing the game for about a week as it takes quite a lot of bingo games to spend the whole £75 after being given a £50 bonus after depositing £25 which isn’t so good an offer anyway. Well after spending it all on bingo over a week I won a total of £0. Not even 1 win. That’s because it’s fixed, only certain names pop up all the time and even know Tombola claim everyone has an equal chance, they are lying. On one of the games you can pick the amount you want to put in for a higher prize, however, people that put in a lower amount have the same chance but win less. Therefore only the people that put in less ever win. For example, I put in a £1 and someone else puts in 25p. If I win a full house I would get £60 and if they get a full house they only win a partial amount, something like £20 meaning that when a person who has bet less wins, Tombola make extra profit. It’s a con and even if they reply to this they will lie and say everyone has an equal chance. Go and play using Coral, it’s a lot faster, buy as many tickets as you like from 5p. I’ve won £150 on a £1 bingo. Should have never tried tombola. Even the bonus at Coral is better."

I only played for a couple of months but won a full house on one occasion only and I did play regularly. I’m not being a bad loser as I understand, likelihood is you’re going to be a loser as are most players. It wasn’t just that occasion, the same accounts do scoop up the winnings all of the time. Even the link games where the money increases dramatically and are significantly more players (around 2000), the same people take the winnings all the time, how is that possible!? \n\nLike I said, I’m not annoyed because I didn’t win I just think it’s ridiculous how the same people win regularly. If you do play, be sure to speak on the chat as most people who do, seem to win! I downloaded it to pass time quite cheaply but won’t be playing any more.\n\n*This review is only of the Bingo Lite section, as I didn’t play much if at all in much of the others game types.*"

I normally use national lottery and have had some good results so figured I’d give this a try. I swear it’s an absolute scam, I’ve never won a single penny! I tried to play certain games and the app refused to let me and wanted me to put MORE money on! Couldn’t withdraw money when I realised it was a waste of time because I’d apparently burnt through my actual cash I’d paid in and was now in “bonus money”. They don’t make it very clear but the app makes sure to swallow your money first and then refuse to give you anything back because your now in “free money”. Chat help is useless and their agents are pretty rude. I’ve seen the same few accounts win time and time again when I’ve never won so much as a penny. They claim it’s random but I’m starting to be convinced that there’s some underhand action going on.\nSave your time and your cash and go elsewhere!"

The reason being is that Tombola have their own computer random pick thousands of names. Because it’s  one of these names that wins That doesn’t really exist Therefore they can show “Winners” names time dates and games/rooms etc. This is Why they can’t show a ticket just a name. Only The Gambling Association Can make them prove a member is real by their personal details.

  "text": "I have joined many bingo sites but the one that stands out for me is Tombola there are many CM's who are friendly and who keep us entertained whilst playing, since joining Tombola I have left just about all other sites as the way the bingo rooms and games and apps are set out are understanding and easy to use, the prizes are much more interesting and many promos to go for and to enjoy. Top site of them all for me."

Really good variety of games to play so it’s doesn’t get too boring, playing the same thing over again. \nMy only little downside, is that I wish I could stick an amount less than £10 on sometimes. I often just want a little flutter and don’t want to use £10."

I’ve met some lovely people and can have a good laugh in the chat rooms at times.  Don’t join if you are predisposed to being a moaner because winning is not guaranteed!! I’ve won a handful of jackpots, so it can be done 😍"

The CMs are fab, the money they play for is way more better than any other site I’ve played & you can’t play multiple games where you can lose a fortune unlike some other sites. 100% trust worthy"

  "text": "The game is oright I put a tenner or and won £71 but soon as I withdraws it and played rest of my money I couldn’t win then I turned to put another tenner on got down to ones and twos and still didn’t win then altogether I’ve put on £60 and still have won and thing the game is a fix it chooses there to win winner because when I was playing the same winners just kept winning and winning so I suggest you don’t play because when you do win you won’t win again your just giving them their money back the game is a utter joke and a scam!"

The CM's are always friendly and ive made a lot of online bingo buddies. Tombola is fun, simple to use and it comes highly recommended by me. If you're downloading then best of luck!! Need2winxx 😊"

  "text": "People will say oh yeah I’ve won the jp .... but they’re the same people who win over and over .... something fishy about that .... so many people losing money, they let you know this in the chat ... but they get told to shut up by other players playing claiming that the game is so good. It’s really not, I noticed I was winning a wee bit when I started playing but once you’ve made a withdrawal say goodbye to your hard earned cash because you won’t see much winnings after that. \nDon’t say I didn’t warn you."

  "text": "This is without doubt the worst bingo site I’ve ever played on with regards to winning. I’ve spent hundreds and won next to nothing. Like a few bingo sites the same names come up time and again. It’s like there’s a list of the chosen few and the rest of us are there making up the numbers and the kitty. I would not recommend this site to anyone. Save your money and go elsewhere. As for the App, since the recent change to the site, it’s slow and jerky. All in all, the whole experience is rubbish."
