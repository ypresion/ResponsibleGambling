It often signs you out not long after logging you in, and is just generally terrible. \n\nThey offer a lot more markets than most, but the quality of the app forces you to not take advantage of them. Do not recommend."

If you do manage to win some it would take forever to turn over that much to actually see your bonus! Wrong in my opinion.\n\nNow on to the app, very slick looking, but that's were it ends! Navigation is poor, no easy way to find games/matches for that day, weird logging in and out sometimes it logs you back in sometimes you go back after 2 mins and you have to log back in again. Can be slow at times and error messages constantly. Also a better my bets page is needed. And faster settling of bets. Needs more markets for sports as well such as lower league clubs and darts games.\n\nHas potential to be amazing but needs a lot of work!\n\n1 star at the moment for me."

Wait 60 secs to bet on the same choice again, this means if you have a multiple and just want to change it even slightly for a new bet you have to wait 60 seconds. 2018 - Tried again a year later and even worse, agree with everyone who says it‚Äôs difficult to withdraw money.
