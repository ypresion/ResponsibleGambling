  "text": "I play bingo only occasionally but play slots a scratch card a few times a week. The reason I don‚Äôt play bingo is like one off your other reviews I have read is that the same names keep coming up no matter what time of day or which bingo house you play. I have tried playing just 6 cards or as many as you could buy, still only the odd win, but never say 1 line then the next two lines or a line then the full house. However, at least a couple of names appeared as winners time and time again, this also used to happen when Gala Bingo was on the TV before the app to play on line. It even happens in the bingo halls the same people win time and time again, when you are waiting for one number it is so maddening when one of those said people call and win the game. In the halls you hear people around you tut tutting and whispering ‚Äúthem again‚Äù , I also know that some have stopped playing Bingo because  of this, as they are limited to only being able to afford the minimal number as they like to most days for the company and chats. Is that what you want New younger players?\nI will continue to play the slots etc until I think the Bingo will seem to being played fairer where by lots of different names appear as winners.

Decided to just take it and quit the app. What an absolute joke! So I deposited my ¬£10 but wanted my withdrawal via bank transfer. It does let you do this on the app. Then you get an email that tells you, you can‚Äôt withdraw a different way to the way you deposited so the withdrawal has been cancelled. So then I tried to log back in to withdraw the same way I deposited. Somehow, and even after numerous conversations with gala, this account ended up being closed!!!!! I spoke with customer support via live chat which was painful only to eventually find out that account had been suspended, god only knows why!!!! Then gala gave me another user name which then ended up also being suspended!!! The whole thing was a shambles and I‚Äôm still trying to get my ¬£89 back after sending my driving license twice as proof of ID and address. It will be an absolute miracle if I get this money.
