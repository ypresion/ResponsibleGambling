  "text": "I‚Äôm 10 months in and won ¬£900 in dividends and my portfolio value is ¬£2100. I‚Äôm no expert so anyone can do it. It‚Äôs jut announced its going worldwide so expect huge growth soon so great time to get into it. My one tip - follow some football index ‚Äòexperts‚Äô on Twitter. Lots of my most profitable purchases have been tips (free) from these guys. On many of these occasions I‚Äôve never heard of the player!"

  "text": "The app is a great idea and adds excitement to games. The app itself isn‚Äôt easy to use. If I here some new signing rumours or an injury and I want to buy that player quick I find myself spending 10-20 mins trying to find that one player, having to spell there name exactly right, googling there official names. It would make it a lot easier if you could search by team, league, nationally all in one search bar. Great concept I just find it very temperamental using it."

  "text": "Signed up to football index over 2 years ago and the returns have been quite exceptional. I confess I don‚Äôt know a lot about football so I bought the top 100 tracker and it has made steady returns over this period plus dividends. Someone with better football knowledge than myself the possibilities to make money must be endless."

  "title": "Amazing alternative to footy Betting",
  "text": "I‚Äôve been on the app for 3 years+ now and roughly make about 7%+ returns a month with very little checking and over 550% returns so far :D\n If you‚Äôre tired of stressful football betting, try football index, it‚Äôs more of a long term approach so be patient, but well worth it compared to traditional betting and even savings accounts!"

  "text": "FI is a brilliant idea for football fans that like to think they know a lot about football. It‚Äôs great speculating which players will perform and which players other fans love. The dividends payouts keeps your portfolio interesting and targets the star players for your portfolio.\n\nThe app is quick, smart and very user friendly. Very simplistic for an index."

  "text": "Really good stocks/shares version with football. \nAlthough would like more performance related data & price rises as it tends to be only popular players from popular teams who consistently reap rewards. (Whether playing well or not. I.e. pogba) \nWhereas a high performing player from a lesser known team will often go unnoticed even if playing well."

  "text": "As stated on the title, the only underlying issue I have is the Buzz news section. It‚Äôs great to see the list sources but opening them is the problem. On opening, the link is loaded but the spinning wheel blocks us from scrolling. \n\nApart from that, I think if this app has filters: Biggest Increase and Biggest Decrease, on the portfolio, it would be the ultimate app!"
