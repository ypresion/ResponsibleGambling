I played an instant game that was in two parts, lost the first part won £1 on the second part. I got the congratulations message... only to head back to the home page to see it hadn’t paid the winnings out. Now I’m sure a lot of people may be thinking “disgruntled player” however I know what happened, and I regret not taking a screen shot of the “you’ve won £1” message, but why would/should I? It had never happened before.. or had it? There been a number of times the app has crashed mid game only to log back in to find my “result” which has always been a loss, not to mention taken the fun of why I purchased the game in the first place. Where was my proof it was a losing game?... because they said so that’s where. I’ve emailed them only to get the face palm of “it shows as a losing ticket” we will escalate this further for you. I’ve read the reviews as far back as I could be bothered and have only found 2 similar complaints so maybe it’s a rare glitch. But maybe also Camelot rely on customer complacency just like the PPI companies did all them years back. Given the lengths I’ve gone to try to recover such a small amount I’d be amazed if there isn’t more to this. Even I initially didn’t bother complaining. Would love to know if others have had the same issue. Anyway, 1 star for theft."

  "text": "This feedback is regarding the iOS app. We are in the 21st century yet this app looks and runs like a 1970s Atari game. The most unintuitive app I have ever come across. It appears to have been written by someone who has never seen a comparative modern App and manages to make everything as difficult as possible. Try changing your regular draw numbers. You would think this would be managed in “my account”, “my games” or maybe “account settings” or even “personalisation “ at the very least. I googled how to do it and saw the information from the national lottery website, telling me to delete the payslip. How?, no details explaining this were given, why? I found it under “direct debit”, obviously. I wanted to change my numbers after winning nothing for 10 years. Delete the playslip the site said, which I actually managed to do. Add a new playslip it said. But gave no indication on how to do it. And then I got bored. I couldn’t bothered trawling through the whole app or equally unimpressive website. I’m sure adding a new play slip comes under address details, or leave feedback, such is the unhelpfulness of this primitive application. Considering the collosal amounts of money given to the lottery, you would like to think they could have provided an app that wasn’t written by a child from the 70s. Postcode lottery here I come."

Obviously can't just use a card, oh no, have to mess about adding a minimum of £10. Then, navigate the mess to be prompted with \"numbers saved in your account\" vs \"numbers saved in your app\". Why would I care? Either I saved them or I didn't. \nEventually, successfully bought a ticket. Draw takes place: did I win??? How the hell would I know? The system could email (I think it does on the odd occasion you do actually win), alert, at least provide SOME indication, rather than having to navigate through many screens after logging in AGAIN. Results checker is laughable. Who cares what numbers came up? The only question I want an answer to is \"can I abandon this wage slave life and embark on a voyage into my dreams?\" That'll be a deep dive into the appalling web-browser interface within the app then, dismissing the cookie warning on the way. Eventually you'll have your hopes dashed, then have to go back through the purchasing rigmarole for another chance. Awful."

The Instant win section is almost impossible to use and navigate. Gone is the option to choose how the games are displayed (i.e. Oldest / Newest /  Odds / Price). There’s no graphics to see what the games looks like before you play them. I have no idea who thought this shambles of a “stripped back” design was the best way to celebrate 25 years. Bring back the old app or at least some of the functions and design features. I dread to think how much money was wasted on this design.

At that time I was buying tickets daily, as I’m not earning quite as much now and since the birth of my grandson, I’ve not got as much disposable income, that coupled with the fact I never win anything but the very lowest of wins available, I generally play if there’s a rollover or I’ve a spare few pounds. \nIt is a great App and it saves time and energy for sure but I would like to have the ability to buy tickets later at night when you’ve forgotten to buy tickets during the day but that’s just me and does not detract from the fact this is a great app."

I know I haven’t won because I don’t get an email.  When I go into the app to check, I have to click 6 times to see how close I got.  How many did win?  What was the prize distribution?  Does’t tell you (or maybe it’s in a submenu somewhere).\nThey could instead send you an email, “click here to see the draw” then you watch an animation of the draw with your numbers at the bottom being highlighted as they come up.  Then when you don’t win, they show you how many did and you at least think, “Maybe next time”!\nOverall it’s functional but could be so much better."

  "text": "This app has improved greatly over the years. \n\nBut I have 2 comments...\n1. When I used to buy king term tickets using this app by direct debit, I found thst after a while I was winning nothing each week. The minute I logged in to check if my ticket was still valid etc, the next draw I would win a small amount. Then I’d leave it again, and find I’m winning nothing, login to check, and the next draw I win something...this story repeats forever. I know that’s not how probability of this game works, but an observation which makes me suspicious of playing by direct debit. \n\n2.  Now I buy tickets using cash in different shops. The scan ticket function is really good to check the results. But it just tells me if I won or didn’t and what numbers were a match. It would be nice if they could also display the results for that draw on the same screen, so I could do a visual comparison myself for extra reassurance. Rather than just taking the apps word for it. Hopefully this is an easy update to make and can be included in a near future update."

For example there should be a dedicated 'My Current Tickets' section, rather than going through ‘My Account’. Also, creating new tickets using an old entry would be good (made easier than currently where you don’t have saved numbers). Messages should be able to be removed in bulk selection rather than one at a time.\nThis app has improved massively though over the years it should be said. Not quite perfect yet but very usable and getting better."

If you fancy winning, don’t bother: the odds of winning are terrible and I get that huge jackpots make for great shouty adverts, but the huge differences in payout amounts between top prizes and the levels below, as well as the constant roll-overs because no one’s actually winning, take away any fun: a savings account/app provides more “excitement”."

  "text": "Let’s face it, the reason for playing is the excitement of winning. So when you are notified of a win and check the app you would expect all the bells, whistles and fireworks immediately when you log in. However this doesn’t happen and all you see is opportunities to buy more tickets. Not even a hint that you have won. You have to locate your account then your messages to find what you have won and in a very plain text uninspiring format. Very underwhelming. It gives the impression that Camelot just wants to take your money rather than hand it out. They could learn a lot from the Las Vegas Casino winners experience. They really need to rethink the whole winning experience for their customers. Whoever designs this stuff clearly doesn’t gamble or have a clue about what players want."

I have only used it to check physical tickets I have bought when out and about.\nIt works quickly and is easy to use, however when checking multiple tickets it becomes frustrating having to go back to the home screen to go back to the scanner to check more tickets as once you have scanned one there is no way to easily repeat. What it needs is a button saying “check another” to repeat the process so when checking multiple tickets it cuts down on the unnecessary steps."

If each lotto type was a call to action button then they could find out more information. You could give rules, previous wining number in the month - loads of stuff. \nThe worst part is the side navigation - very outdated and doesn’t look like it belongs to the app. Like it’s been rush or there was no budge for the entire app. \nThe most annoying thing I find it not having a clear view of the current running games, it takes too many clicks to see my running tickets and even when I do find one, it’s really hidden.
