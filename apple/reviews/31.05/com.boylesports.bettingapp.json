Wouldn't mind a football only app as loads on it but I only use football. That said it's easy to find Premiership games and they've added a Bet Builder function so you can add loads of goalscorers, bookings etc etc. in same game."

Ended up losing to a 90+ min goal but checked cash out at 60 mins. Awful betting site. Check your bet as soon as it kicks off they say ‚Äúmarket suspended for this match‚Äù but click on the match and it‚Äôs open for betting. Absolute scam!"
