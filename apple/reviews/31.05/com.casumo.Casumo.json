  "text": "I can‚Äôt really remember where I first saw or heard of Casumo but like most gambling game sites I was a little hesitant. However Casumo has to be my all time favourite app to play on. The games are so fun to play, deposits & withdraws are so easy to make and the team are so fun and so easy to talk to. I 1000% trust Casumo for a fun time and 1000% trust them with my money.  I love the app so much! I also love how they let you know how long you have been on for and how much you might have won or lost so you get a reality check so you don‚Äôt go crazy or do something that you might regret! Casumo is awesome!"

  "text": "CASUMO has got to be one for the worst casinos to come across never won anything more than what has been deposited. Weeks and weeks by and lost over ¬£200 without one withdrawal I know they abide by regulations but ever where else I have played on the exact same games seem to pay out more and run extremely smoother. If I could give 0 stars I would i know it‚Äôs about luck but even read trustpilot reviews the app is a complete scam and traps you in alway under your deposit I have two accounts with Casumo and never seen a profit, will never be using again hope everyone sees this as I‚Äôm not really ever see and reading any good winners on this app."

You have to at least put ¬£100 in to win a bonus and even then every bonus I played was giving me back no more than 50 quid in winnings. Horrible experience for a customer who‚Äôs spent thousands and get nothing back. Never experienced anything like it before as a gambler. Please please use other online casinos because Casumo is definitely the worst I‚Äôve played on. I wouldn‚Äôt even give a star if I could help it."
