I recommend new people wanting to play bingo or other games to down load the sky apps as they pay your winnings into your bank account within 2 working days and do not mess you about like other apps I've played. Would recommend sky to my friends and family as they've not let me down yet . !!!"

I only play what I can afford which is not a lot but affordable for my budget. Plus you can set limits to stay in control of your spending. Good Luck MPQMPQ\nThe app recently has been a bit temperamental and unreliable june/july 2017 many updates happening so hang in there I'm sure the guys at virturefusion are working on making the app the best it can be for sky as I still keep coming back!"
