But losing one particular game wiped out everything you’ve ever owned. At this moment, you finally understood that the so-called American dream for you was just a dream. After that, you lost all the courage and vowed to never play any poker game.\r\n\r\nYou decided to retire, and stayed low in an ordinary ranch in Texas. You worked as a cowboy for three years in that ranch, away from the hassles of the world, but right now a rumor drags you back to reality. Your \"enemy\" who won over you and became the king of poker with despicable means three years ago is sending invitations to all poker players around America to come to Las Vegas. Whether it is another normal game or a conspiracy he set for you, all the puzzles require you to solve by yourself. After some struggles and with encouragement from friends who you care about, you decided to start a new journey.\r\n\r\nMy dear friend, whether to return to the top, or to fall in front of your \"enemy\" once again, you are going to choose your own destiny. \r\n\r\nKey features:\r\n\r\n1.

No problem at all. Just fire up the free EasyPoker app and we will take care of it! Think of the EasyPoker app as a digital poker set. Cool right?\r\n\r\nOur app brings together the best of digital poker and traditional live face to face poker. Now you can play multiplayer F2F poker with your friends, without having to bring a poker set with you at all times. Imagine playing a game of live multiplayer poker around the campfire, at the beach, the bar, the park, in the train, while waiting for food in the restaurant, when skydiving - Really, it’s only limited by your imagination. You and your friends just need the free EasyPoker app on your smartphones and we’ll take care of the rest. \r\n\r\nWhy choose between the convenience of digital poker and the social experience live poker? We’ve combined the two!\r\n\r\nThe EasyPoker gameplay is designed specifically for playing face to face poker with people in the same place as you. Basically just think of EasyPoker as a digital poker set that fits in your pocket.\r\n\r\nGet cool features perfectly designed for a multiplayer game of poker.    \r\n\r\n• Multiplayer Texas Hold’em.\r\n• Cross platform capability (Android, iPhone).\r\n• Provides both cards and chips.\r\n• Fast and intuitive connection of devices. \r\n• Easily arrange order.\r\n• One hand gameplay.\r\n• Tab and hold to see your cards (bad news for peekers).\r\n• No timer - you decide when to deal.\r\n• No credit card registration.\r\n• Free to play.     \r\n\r\nEasyPoker is Not your classic poker app. Far from it actually.

It is played on a computerized console similar in size to a slot machine.\r\nAfter inserting money (or a barcoded paper ticket with credit) into the machine, play begins by placing a bet of one or more credits and pressing the \"deal\" button. The player is then given cards and has the opportunity to discard one or more of them in exchange for new ones drawn from the same virtual deck. After the draw, the machine pays out if the hand or hands played match one of the winning combinations, which are posted in the pay table.\r\nPay tables allocate the payouts for hands and are based on how rare they are, the game variation, and the decision of the game operator. A typical pay table starts with a minimum hand of a pair of jacks, which pays even money. All the other hand combinations in video poker are the same as in table poker, including such hands as two pair, three of a kind, straight (a sequence of 5 cards of different suits), flush (any 5 cards of the same suit), full house (a pair and a three of a kind), four of a kind (four cards of the same value), straight flush (5 consecutive cards of the same suit) and royal flush (a Ten, a Jack, a Queen, a King and an Ace of the same suit).\r\nThere are many variations of video poker. They include Deuces Wild, where a two serves as a wild card, pay schedule modification, where four aces with a five or smaller kicker pays an enhanced amount (these games usually have some adjective in the title such as \"bonus\", \"double\", or \"triple\"); and multi-play poker, where the player starts with a base hand, and each additional played hand draws from a different set of cards with the base hand. (Multi-play games are offered in \"Triple Play\", \"Five Play\", \"Ten Play\", \"Fifty Play\" and \"One Hundred Play\" versions.)\r\nIn games which do not have a wild card a player on average will receive the rare four-of-a-kind hand approximately once every 500 hands, while a player may play tens of thousands of hands before an extremely rare royal flush, which usually has the highest payout.\r\n\"Jacks or Better,\" sometimes simply called \"Draw Poker,\" is the most common variation of video poker. Payoffs begin at a pair of jacks. Full pay Jacks or Better is also known as 9/6 Jacks or Better since the payoff for a full house is 9 credits and the payoff for a flush is 6 credits.\r\n\r\nFor Support or any help/suggestions contact us at : support@phonato.com",

  "description": "WiFi Poker Room is Texas Holdem poker with friends around you over WiFi. No cards or chips? Tired of constant shuffling? This app does it for you! Organize a home game or play poker while travelling on the train or airplane! \r\n\r\nThis game is local multiplayer that can be played offline. You just need to be connected to the same WiFi network or hotspot. No need to register, just create a table, connect and play some poker!\r\n\r\nWiFi Poker Room is a great replacement to traditional poker game with cards and chips. Not everyone owns chips and even though playing with real cards is fun - shuffling is not. With this app it takes just a second to shuffle and deal cards. Bet amounts, pots and winnings are all counted for you, no room to make a mistake. You cannot bet or fold out of turn which often happens in home games. In our experience, it makes home games about 3 to 4 times faster. Being card dead can ruin a poker evening. If you can play 80 hands in an hour instead of 20 you will have a much bigger chance to actually play some good poker.\r\n\r\nLocal multiplayer nature of the game allows you play with friends around you. Observing your opponents reactions is a big part of Texas Holdem poker. You may end up making a great call or a ridiculously good fold only because you saw your friends shaky hands. Online poker does not give you this opportunity.\r\n\r\nPlaying at home is fine but why not play on the move? This 4 hour car trip, or even longer flights, might be much more tolerable if you could enjoy some good poker. Make a hotspot out of your device and play completely offline. You don't need space, card or chips, just your phone and at least one more friend willing to play you.\r\n\r\nInvite your friends over for a new kind of home game.\r\n\r\n★★★ REAL POKER EXPERIENCE ★★★\r\nCards are dealt face down as in real life. You don't need to hide your phone. Put it in front of you and take a look when you're ready and no-one is watching. When you make a great bluff show a card or two, it can really tilt your opponents... Use gestures to check and fold! Poker players often knock on the table to check and slide their cards to fold. So can you!\r\n\r\n★★★ OFFLINE MULTIPLAYER ★★★\r\nThis game is local multiplayer. You need at least 2 Android or iOS devices to play. Up to 10 supported! Connect to the same WiFi network and start a game at selected stakes. Your table will be visible only to other players on the local WiFi network.\r\n\r\n★★★ NO INTERNET NEEDED ★★★\r\nPlaying offline multiplayer means you do not need to have internet connection to play. When you're travelling create a personal hotspot from your device. If you're worried about mobile data usage just disable it. No online logins or registration required.\r\n\r\n★★★ FASTER GAMEPLAY ★★★\r\nTexas Holdem is fun but shuffling cards and dealing takes a long time, especially when playing heads-up. Now it's just one press of a button! Tired of reminding your friends the action is on them? Their phones will vibrate when it's their turn to act. You can also poke them!\r\n\r\n★★★ PLAY HISTORY ★★★\r\nAll hands you play are saved so you can analyze your play or search for weak spots in opponents play. \r\n\r\n★★★ GAME SAVING ★★★\r\nIf you have to stop playing, but would like to continue later, don't worry because the game is already saved. When you create a table the game will be saved automatically during play. After reloading players' cards and stack sizes will be restored, and everyone will be able to reconnect to your table. This is a premium feature.\r\n\r\n★★★ RECONNECT AND PLAY ★★★\r\nIf you happen to disconnect from the game, don't worry. You can connect again and continue where you left off.",

The player may look at his own cards.\r\nThe player can check or make a Play bet equal to three or four times the Ante.\r\nThe dealer turns over three community cards.\r\nIf the player previously checked, then he may make a Play bet equal to two times his Ante. If the player already made a Play bet, then he may not bet further.\r\nTwo final community cards are turned over.\r\nIf the player previously checked twice, then he must either make a Play bet equal to exactly his Ante, or fold, losing both his Ante and Blind bets. If the player already raised he may not bet further.\r\nThe player and dealer will both make the best possible hand using any combination of their own two cards and the five community cards.\r\nThe dealer will need at least a pair to qualify.\r\n\r\nKey feature: \r\n\r\n* Gorgeous HD graphics and slick, fast gameplay\r\n* Realistic sounds, and smooth animations\r\n* Fast and clean interface.\r\n* Offline playable: you dont need an internet connection to play this game, it run perfectly fine when offline\r\n* Constant playing: you don't need to wait for other player to play this game\r\n* Completely free: you don't need any money to play this game, the chips in the game are also free to get.\r\n\r\nDownload Ultimate Poker Texas Holdem now for free!\r\n\r\nBlue Wind casino\r\nBring the casino to your home",
