of the messenger app, google translation appears behind it, and consequently forces to switch between apps. And it would be great to have a favorite section in the source and target language dropdown lists, because if we use more languages than the ones in \"recently used\", they start replacing each other. UPDATE : The app never gets the last word that's being said, as if it stoped recording too early !","They went from tap to translate to always on top. the icon is now always getting in my way and I had to shut it off completely so now I have no tap to translate. It was great the way it was. It is too bad they broke it. Fivestars until they broke it. Every other aspect is great. Now because I don't have tap to translate I am back to the old fashioned hopping between apps, which is really slow. Now they are just like any other translator. This app WAS so cool!","Oriya language option is not working. So Google should solve this problem as soon as possible. Again Google translation is having a lot of grammatical errors. This app cannot work with low volume. When we use its Google camera , then words in the sentences are not properly arranged. If you will use its camera to translate a paragraph into Hindi, then you can see, that lines are not straight. Overall it will be a good app, if these problems are resolved by Google as soon as possible. okn","Dumbest app ever! When trying to correct any word in sentences there is only a small space/window to see and work with, and it makes difficult to make any corrections into words, but at the same time there is a huge blank space under that window which is always stays empty and can not be used in anyway! Developers are MORONS !!!!","I do not like this new version. Before the upgrade i would give this app a 5 star. I've never rated a app before in my life until now, this is how upset i am. I liked it before when you copied a text the translate icon bubble would appear and then it would disappear once you've translated your words or created a new sentence. Now it's either always visible even though you don't need it or it's not. That was the main thing i loved about the app and you just got rid of that option. No bueno!"],"editorsChoice":true,"appId":"com.google.android.apps.translate","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.translate&hl=en&gl=us"}
